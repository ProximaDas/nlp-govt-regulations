       " to help determine whether financial institutions are serving the \n",

       " purchases a loan that is, among other things, for the purchase of a \n",
       " home, home improvement, or refinancing, the financial institution must \n",
       " collect and report data on the application or loan. As discussed below \n",

       "     Proposed Sec.  1003.2(o) is issued pursuant to the Bureau's \n",
       " authority under section 305(a) of HMDA. For the reasons given above, \n",
       " the Bureau believes that including dwelling-secured lines of credit \n",
       " within the scope of the regulation is a reasonable interpretation of \n",
       " HMDA section 303(2), which defines ``mortgage loan'' to mean a loan \n",
       " which is secured by residential real property or a home improvement \n",
       " loan. The Bureau interprets that term to include dwelling-secured lines \n",
       " of credit, as those transactions are secured by residential real \n",
       " property, and they may be used for home improvement. As discussed \n",
       " above, information on home-equity lines of credit and dwelling-secured \n",
       " commercial lines of credit would have helped the public understand the \n",

       "     In addition, pursuant to section 305(a) of HMDA, the Bureau \n",
       " believes that this proposed requirement is necessary and proper to \n",
       " effectuate the purposes of HMDA and to prevent circumvention or evasion \n",
       " thereof. For the reasons given above, by requiring all financial \n",
       " institutions to report information regarding home-equity lines of \n",

       " assist in identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and \n",
       " enforcing antidiscrimination statutes.\n",
       " 2(p) Refinancing\n",
       "     HMDA does not expressly define ``refinancing.'' Regulation C \n",
       " currently defines ``refinancing'' to mean a new obligation that \n",
       " satisfies and replaces an existing obligation by the same borrower, \n",
       " subject to two qualifications. In the first qualification, for coverage \n",
       " purposes, the existing obligation is a home purchase loan (as \n",
       " determined by the lender, for example, by reference to available \n",
       " documents; or as stated by the applicant), and both the existing \n",
       " obligation and the new obligation are secured by first liens on \n",
       " dwellings. In the second qualification, for reporting purposes, both \n",
       " the existing obligation and the new obligation are secured by liens on \n",
       " dwellings. For the reasons discussed below, the Bureau is proposing \n",
       " several modifications to clarify and simplify this definition.\n",
       "     The Bureau has received feedback indicating that the current \n",
       " definition of refinancing should be clarified or modified to reduce \n",
       " burden and facilitate compliance. Comments received in response to the \n",
       " 2011 Regulation C Restatement argued that the definition of refinancing \n",
       " in Regulation C should be aligned with the definition in Regulation Z \n",
       " to streamline the regulatory requirements and reduce compliance burden. \n",
       " Other feedback suggests that the current two pronged definition of \n",
       " refinancing--one prong for institutional coverage and one prong for \n",
       " reporting--is also a source of confusion. While the FFIEC published \n",
       " several frequently asked questions to address some of these issues, it \n",
       " appears that some confusion remains.\n",
       "     The Bureau believes that these issues would be best addressed by \n",
       " simplifying the definition and adding clarifying commentary. While \n",
       " financial institutions may often refer to the regulation to determine \n",
       " whether a reportable transaction is considered a refinancing, the \n",
       " Bureau does not believe that financial institutions often reevaluate \n",
       " institutional coverage. When an entity needs to evaluate institutional \n",
       " coverage, it currently needs to refer to the definition of refinancing \n",
       " and financial institution. The Bureau believes that moving the coverage \n",
       " prong to the definition of financial institution would simplify the \n",
       " regulation by placing the information needed to determine institutional \n",
       " coverage in one location. Thus, the Bureau is proposing Sec.  \n",
       " 1003.2(p), which defines a refinancing to mean a covered loan in which \n",
       " a new debt obligation satisfies and replaces an existing debt \n",
       " obligation by the same borrower, in which both the existing debt \n",
       " obligation and the new debt obligation are secured by liens on \n",
       " dwellings. The Bureau solicits feedback regarding whether these \n",
       " proposed modifications are appropriate, and whether additional \n",
       " clarification is necessary.\n",
       "     Proposed comment 2(p)-1 discusses the definition in Sec.  1003.2(p) \n",
       " and provides illustrative examples of the definition. This proposed \n",
       " comment also clarifies that, if a borrower enters into a new debt \n",
       " obligation that modifies that terms of the existing debt obligation, \n",
       " but does not satisfy and replace the existing debt obligation, the new \n",
       " debt obligation is not a refinancing for purposes of Sec.  1003.2(p). \n",
       " Proposed comment 2(p)-2 explains that, for purposes of determining \n",
       " whether the transaction is a refinancing under Sec.  1003.2(p), both \n",
       " the new debt obligation and the existing debt obligation must be \n",
       " secured by liens on dwellings, and provides several illustrative \n",
       " examples. Proposed comment 2(p)-3 clarifies that the existing and new \n",
       " obligation must both be by the same borrower. This proposed comment \n",
       " provides examples of common scenarios that illustrate this proposed \n",
       " definition.\n",
       " 2(q) Reverse Mortgage\n",
       "     Currently, neither HMDA nor Regulation C expressly addresses \n",
       " reverse mortgages. However, reverse mortgages that are home purchase \n",
       " loans, home improvement loans, or refinancings under the current \n",
       " definitions in Sec.  1003.2 are subject to the data collection and \n",
       " reporting requirements of Regulation C.\n",

       " \n",
       " [[Page 51760]]\n",
       " \n",

       " the citizens and public officials of the United States with sufficient \n",
       " information to enable them to determine whether financial institutions \n",
       " are filling their obligations to serve the housing needs of the \n",
       " communities and neighborhoods in which they are located. Furthermore, \n",
       " private institutions and nonprofit organizations, as well as local, \n",
       " State, and Federal programs, traditionally have facilitated or engaged \n",
       " in reverse mortgage lending. However, the proprietary market for \n",
       " reverse mortgages has substantially declined in recent years. Thus, \n",
       " requiring improved information regarding all reverse mortgages would \n",
       " assist public officials in their determination of the distribution of \n",
       " public sector investments in a manner designed to improve the private \n",
       " investment environment. In addition, State officials provided feedback \n",
       " during the 2010 Board Hearings that expanding the transactional \n",
       " coverage of Regulation C to include all reverse mortgages would assist \n",
       " in the identification of discriminatory and other potentially harmful \n",

       " In addition, the Bureau has received feedback that overlapping or \n",

       " Sec.  1003.4(a)(13) for reverse mortgages, because reverse mortgages \n",

       " single authoritative source that delivers or maintains parcel \n",
       " numbering. Parcel data are collected and maintained by individual local \n",
       " governments with limited State or Federal involvement. Local \n",
       " jurisdictions do not use a standard way to identify properties. In \n",
       " addition, local parcel data are not easily linked to the location of \n",
       " the property, which, as discussed above, substantially amplifies the \n",
       " usefulness of a parcel identifier. Both the postal address and \n",
       " geospatial coordinates of a property are linked to the location of the \n",
       " property and uniquely identify most properties. However, there may be \n",
       " inaccuracies associated with both postal address and geospatial \n",
       " coordinates. For example, neither the postal address nor the geospatial \n",
       " coordinates may be available at the time of origination for properties \n",
       " located in new developments. In addition, both postal address and \n",
       " geospatial coordinates present standardization issues. Financial \n",
       " institutions may not collect and record postal address in the same \n",
       " format. Likewise, financial institutions may not use the same methods \n",
       " for collecting and recording geospatial coordinates. The Bureau \n",
       " understands that financial institutions currently collect postal \n",
       " address during the mortgage origination and application process if the \n",
       " postal address is available, but that not all financial institutions \n",
       " collect geospatial coordinates.\n",
       "     In addition to the practical challenges discussed above, the Bureau \n",
       " recognizes that including a parcel identifier in the HMDA data raises \n",
       " privacy concerns because a parcel identifier, like a postal address, \n",
       " can easily be used to identify a borrower. The Bureau is sensitive to \n",

       " requirements of Regulation C, to the extent practicable, to existing \n",
       " industry standards for collecting and transmitting mortgage data. In \n",
       " furtherance of this proposed alignment, the Bureau determined that a \n",

       " priority of the lien against the subject property and provides for the \n",
       " following enumerations: First lien, second lien, third lien, fourth \n",
       " lien, and other. The ``other'' enumeration is designed to capture the \n",
       " priority of the lien against the subject property beyond a fourth lien, \n",
       " for example, a fifth lien or sixth lien.\n",
       "     Given that loan terms, including loan pricing, vary based on lien \n",
       " status, and in light of the Bureau's proposal to require reporting of \n",
       " certain pricing data for purchased loans, such as the interest rate, \n",
       " the Bureau believes that requiring financial institutions to report the \n",
       " lien status of purchased loans would further enhance the utility of \n",
       " HMDA data overall. The liquidity provided by the secondary market is a \n",
       " critical component of the modern mortgage market, and information about \n",
       " the types of loans being purchased in a particular area, and the \n",
       " pricing terms associated with those purchased loans, is needed to \n",
       " understand whether the housing needs of communities are being \n",

       " communities where neighborhood revitalization and affordable housing \n",
       " efforts depend on the liquidity provided by purchasers of mortgage \n",
       " loans. Thus, by requiring additional information on subordinate lien \n",
       " lending, the Bureau believes that this proposal would ensure that the \n",
       " public and public officials are provided with sufficient information to \n",
       " enable them to determine whether financial institutions are fulfilling \n",
       " their obligations to serve the housing needs of the communities and \n",
       " neighborhoods in which they are located. Furthermore, local and State \n",
       " housing finance agency programs facilitate the mortgage market for low- \n",
       " to moderate-income borrowers, often by offering programs to purchase or \n",
       " insure loans originated by a private institution. Since the HMDA data \n",
       " reported by financial institutions does not include the lien status of \n",
       " purchased loans, it is difficult to determine the pricing \n",
       " characteristics of the private secondary market. Lien status \n",
       " information on purchased loans would help public entities, such as \n",
       " local and State housing finance agencies, understand how to complement \n",
       " the liquidity provided by the secondary market in certain communities, \n",
       " thereby maximizing the effectiveness of such public programs. Thus, the \n",
       " Bureau believes that requiring that such data be reported would assist \n",
       " public officials in their determination of the distribution of public \n",
       " sector investments in a manner designed to improve the private \n",
       " investment environment. Additionally, providing lien status information \n",

       "     The mortgage industry generally operates through three primary \n",
       " application channels: retail, wholesale, and correspondent. These \n",
       " channels are often characterized by three factors: (1) which \n",
       " institution received the application directly from the applicant, (2) \n",
       " which institution made the credit decision, and (3) in which \n",
       " institution's name the loan closed (i.e., to whom the obligation \n",
       " initially was payable). The term ``retail channel'' generally refers to \n",
       " situations where the applicant submits the application directly to the \n",
       " financial institution that makes the credit decision on the application \n",
       " and to whom the obligation is initially payable.\n",
       "     On the other hand, the term ``wholesale channel,'' which is also \n",
       " referred to as the ``broker channel,'' generally refers to situations \n",
       " where the applicant submits the application to a mortgage broker and \n",
       " the broker sends the application to a financial institution that makes \n",
       " the credit decision on the application and to whom the obligation is \n",
       " initially payable. The wholesale channel may also include some \n",
       " arrangements, such as table funding, in which the obligation is not \n",
       " initially payable to the financial institution that makes the credit \n",
       " decision.\n",
       "     The third channel includes correspondent arrangements between two \n",

       " not accepted. Because the 14 percent represents only institutions that \n",
       " chose to report preapproval requests approved but not accepted, the \n",
       " percentage if the proposal were adopted would likely be higher. For \n",
       " certain institutions with large preapproval programs, the percentage of \n",

       " B. Statement of Need\n",
       " \n",
       " 1. HMDA's Purposes and the Current Deficiencies in Regulation C\n",
       "     Congress intended HMDA to provide the public and public officials \n",
       " with information to help determine whether financial institutions are \n",
       " serving the housing needs of their communities, to target public \n",
       " investment to attract private investment in communities, and to \n",
       " identify possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforce \n",
       " antidiscrimination statutes. Today, HMDA data are the preeminent data \n",
       " source for regulators, researchers, economists, industry, and advocates \n",
       " analyzing the mortgage market both for the three stated purposes of \n",
       " HMDA and for general market monitoring. For example, HMDA data are used \n",
       " by bank supervisors to evaluate depository institutions for purposes of \n",
       " the CRA; by local groups as the basis for discussions with lenders \n",
       " about local community needs; and by regulators, community groups, and \n",
       " researchers to identify disparities in mortgage lending that may \n",
       " provide evidence of prohibited discrimination. In addition, HMDA data \n",
       " provide a broadly representative, national picture of home lending that \n",
       " is unavailable from any other data source. This information permits \n",
       " users to monitor market conditions and trends, such as the supply and \n",
       " demand of applications and originations. For example, industry uses \n",
       " HMDA data to identify and meet the needs of underserved markets through \n",
       " potentially profitable lending and investment opportunities.\n",
       "     HMDA data include records regarding applications by mortgage \n",
       " borrowers and records regarding the flow of funding from lenders to \n",
       " borrowers. Together, these records form a near-census of the home \n",
       " mortgage market for covered loans and applications, with rich \n",
       " geographical detail (down to census tract level) and identification of \n",
       " the specific financial institution for each transaction. Therefore, \n",
       " HMDA allows users to draw a detailed picture of the supply and demand \n",
       " of mortgage credit at various levels of geography and lender \n",
       " aggregation.\n",
       "     Despite past improvements, however, serious inadequacies exist in \n",
       " the information currently collected under Regulation C. HMDA data can \n",
       " generally be used to calculate underwriting and pricing disparities \n",
       " across various protected classes in mortgage lending, at the national, \n",
       " market, and individual-lender levels. Nevertheless, the data lack key \n",
       " fields that explain legitimate underwriting and pricing decisions for \n",
       " mortgage loans. Therefore, in most cases, HMDA data alone cannot \n",
       " demonstrate whether borrowers and applicants have received \n",
       " nondiscriminatory treatment by financial institutions. Additional \n",
       " proposed data points, such as credit score, AUS recommendations, CLTV, \n",
       " and DTI, would help users understand the reasons for approvals and \n",
       " denials of applications and for pricing decisions regarding \n",
       " originations. Similarly, current HMDA data provide certain information \n",
       " about borrowers (race, ethnicity, sex, income, and location) and loans \n",
       " (loan amount, purpose, loan type, occupancy, lien status, and property \n",
       " type). However, the current data points do not fully characterize the \n",
       " types of loans for which consumers are applying and do not explain why \n",
       " some applications are denied. The additional proposed data points, such \n",
       " as non-amortizing features, prepayment penalties, and loan terms, would \n",
       " help fill these important information gaps.\n",
       "     Additionally, analysis of the cost of credit to mortgage borrowers \n",
       " is incomplete without the inclusion of key pricing information. The \n",
       " current rate spread reporting requirement requires financial \n",
       " institutions to report rate spread only for higher-priced mortgage \n",
       " loans. Currently, such loans comprise less than 5 percent of total \n",
       " originations. These limited data restrict analysis of the cost of \n",
       " credit to a small segment of total mortgage originations and create \n",
       " severe selection bias as changes in the market lead to shifts in the \n",
       " average spreads between APR values and APOR. Adding the proposed \n",
       " pricing data fields, such as discount points, risk-adjusted, pre-\n",
       " discounted interest rate, origination charges, interest rate, and total \n",
       " points and fees, will allow users to better understand the price that \n",
       " consumers pay for mortgages and more effectively analyze the tradeoffs \n",
       " between rates, points, and fees.\n",
       "     HMDA also currently provides limited information about the property \n",
       " that secures or will secure the loan. Despite being one of the most \n",
       " important characteristics for underwriting and pricing decisions, the \n",
       " value of the property securing the loan has not been collected under \n",
       " the current HMDA reporting requirements. The proposed rule would \n",
       " address this deficiency by providing for reporting of the value of the \n",
       " property securing the covered loan or application. Current HMDA data \n",
       " also lack information about the manufactured housing segment of the \n",

       " 2. Improving HMDA Data To Address Market Failures\n",
       "     HMDA does not regulate the interactions between lenders and \n",
       " borrowers. Instead, HMDA requires financial institutions to report \n",
       " detailed information to their Federal supervisory agencies and to the \n",
       " public about mortgage applications and originations at the transaction \n",
       " level. Such information provides an important public good that \n",
       " illuminates the lending activities of financial institutions and the \n",
       " mortgage market in general. This increased transparency allows members \n",
       " of the public, community groups, and public officials to better assess \n",
       " compliance with various Federal laws and regulations. In doing so, HMDA \n",
       " data help correct the potential market failures that those laws and \n",
       " regulations were designed to address.\n",
       "     From the perspective of economics, the proposed improvements to \n",
       " HMDA would address two market failures: (1) The under-production of \n",
       " public mortgage data by the private sector, and (2) the information \n",
       " asymmetries present in credit markets.\n",
       "     First, HMDA data is a public good in that it is both non-rival, \n",
       " meaning that it may be used without reducing the amount available for \n",
       " others, and non-excludable, meaning that it cannot be withheld from \n",
       " consumers who do not pay for it. As with other public goods, standard \n",
       " microeconomic principles dictate that public mortgage data would be \n",
       " under-produced by the private sector, creating an outcome that is not \n",
       " socially optimal. Not surprisingly, no privately produced loan-level \n",
       " mortgage databases with comprehensive national coverage exist that are \n",
       " easily accessible by the public. Private data vendors offer a few large \n",
       " databases for sale that typically contain data collected from either \n",
       " the largest servicers or securitizers. However, none of these databases \n",
       " match the near-universal coverage of the HMDA data.\\593\\ Furthermore, \n",
       " commercial datasets come at high cost to subscribers, creating a \n",
       " substantial hurdle for community groups, government agencies, and \n",
       " researchers that wish to obtain access. Importantly, these commercially \n",
       " available datasets typically do not identify individual lenders and \n",
       " therefore cannot be used to study whether specific lenders are meeting \n",
       " community needs or making nondiscriminatory credit decisions. In \n",
       " addition, all privately produced, commercially available mortgage \n",
       " databases cover only originated loans and exclude applications that do \n",
       " not result in originations. A crucial feature of the HMDA data is that \n",
       " they include information about applications in addition to \n",
       " originations. In other words, in economic terms, private mortgage \n",
       " databases only provide information about the market outcome resulting \n",
       " from the intersection of supply and demand, while HMDA data provide \n",
       " information about both the market outcome and the demand for credit. \n",
       " Thus, users can examine both supply and demand regarding mortgage \n",
       " credit and understand the reasons for discrepancies between supply and \n",
       " demand at various levels of analysis, including by lender, geographic \n",

       "     Second, it is well-accepted that credit markets are characterized \n",

       " highly complex, and lenders have a significant information advantage. \n",
       " Such information asymmetry affects price and quantity allocations and \n",
       " can contribute to types of lender behavior, such as discrimination or \n",
       " predatory lending, that conflict with the best interests of consumers. \n",
       " In addition to disadvantaging individual consumers, information failure \n",
       " may also lead to herding behavior by both lenders and consumers, \n",

       " E. Basic Approach of the Bureau's Consideration of Benefits and Costs \n",
       " and Data Limitations\n",
       " \n",
       "     This discussion relies on data that the Bureau has obtained from \n",
       " industry, other regulatory agencies, and publicly available sources. \n",
       " However, as discussed further below, the data limit the Bureau's \n",
       " ability to quantify the potential costs, benefits, and impacts of the \n",
       " proposed rule.\n",
       " 1. Costs to Covered Persons\n",
       "     Regarding the costs to covered persons, the proposed rule generally \n",
       " establishes which financial institutions, transactions, and data points \n",
       " are covered under HMDA's reporting requirements. In order to precisely \n",
       " quantify the costs to covered persons, the Bureau would need, for both \n",
       " current and potential HMDA reporters, representative data on the \n",
       " operational costs that financial institutions incur to gather and \n",
       " report HMDA data, one-time costs for financial institutions to update \n",
       " reporting infrastructure in response to the proposed rule, and \n",
       " information on the level of complexity of financial institutions' \n",
       " business models and compliance systems. Currently, the Bureau does not \n",
       " believe that data on HMDA reporting costs with this level of \n",
       " granularity is systematically available from any source. The Bureau has \n",
       " made reasonable efforts to gather data on HMDA reporting costs. Through \n",
       " outreach efforts with industry, community groups, and other regulatory \n",
       " agencies, the Bureau has obtained some information about ongoing \n",
       " operational and one-time compliance costs, and the discussion below \n",
       " uses this information to quantify certain costs of the proposed rule. \n",
       " The Bureau believes that the discussion constitutes the most \n",
       " comprehensive assessment to date of the costs of HMDA reporting by \n",
       " financial institutions. However, the Bureau recognizes that these \n",
       " calculations may not fully quantify the costs to covered persons, \n",
       " especially given the wide variation of HMDA reporting costs among \n",
       " financial institutions. The Bureau continues to seek data from \n",
       " available sources in order to better quantify the costs to covered \n",
       " persons.\n",
       "     More specifically, in considering the benefits, costs, and impacts \n",
       " of the proposed rule, the Bureau has engaged in a series of efforts to \n",
       " estimate the cost of compliance by covered entities. First, the Bureau \n",
       " attempted to understand and estimate the current cost of reporting for \n",
       " financial institutions, i.e. the baseline cost at the institution \n",
       " level. Second, the Bureau evaluated the change in financial \n",
       " institutions' operational and one-time costs in response to the \n",
       " proposed changes. Part VI.F, below, provides details on the Bureau's \n",
       " approach in performing these institution-level analyses. The Bureau \n",
       " realizes that costs vary by institution due to many factors, such as \n",
       " size, operational structure, and product complexity, and that this \n",
       " variance exists on a continuum that is impossible to fully represent. \n",
       " In order to conduct a cost consideration that is both practical and \n",
       " meaningful, the Bureau has chosen an approach that focuses on three \n",
       " representative tiers of financial institutions. For each tier, the \n",
       " Bureau has produced a reasonable estimate of the cost of compliance \n",
       " given the limitations of the available data. Part VI.F.2, below, \n",
       " provides additional details on this approach. More elaboration is \n",

       "     Having generated estimates of the cost impact on covered financial \n",
       " institutions, the Bureau attempted to estimate the costs to consumers. \n",
       " According to economic theory, in a perfectly competitive market where \n",
       " financial institutions are profit maximizers, the\n",
       " \n",
       " [[Page 51823]]\n",
       " \n",
       " affected financial institutions would pass on to consumers the \n",
       " marginal, i.e. variable, cost per application or origination, and \n",
       " absorb the one-time and increased fixed costs of complying with the \n",
       " rule. The Bureau received feedback through the Small Business Review \n",
       " Panel process that, if the market permitted, some small entities would \n",
       " attempt to pass on to consumers the entire amount of the increased cost \n",
       " of compliance and not just the increase in variable costs. Because the \n",
       " competiveness, supply-demand conditions, and impact of market failures \n",
       " may vary across different markets, the Bureau seeks additional comment \n",
       " on the costs to consumers.\n",
       " 3. Benefits to Consumers and Covered Persons\n",
       "     Quantifying benefits to consumers also presented substantial \n",
       " challenges. As discussed above, Congress intended for HMDA, including \n",
       " the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to the Act and the Bureau's rules \n",
       " implementing HMDA, to achieve compelling social benefits. The Bureau is \n",
       " unable to readily quantify some of these benefits with precision, both \n",
       " because the Bureau does not have the data to quantify all benefits and \n",
       " because the Bureau is not able to assess completely how effective the \n",
       " Dodd-Frank amendments to HMDA will be in achieving those benefits. As \n",
       " explained elsewhere in this supplementary information, the Bureau \n",
       " believes that its proposals appropriately implement the statutory \n",
       " amendments and are necessary and proper to effectuate HMDA's purposes. \n",
       " As discussed further below, as a data reporting rule, most provisions \n",
       " of the proposal would benefit consumers in indirect ways. Nevertheless, \n",
       " the Bureau believes that the impact of enhanced transparency would \n",
       " substantially benefit consumers. For example, the proposed rule would \n",
       " facilitate the detection and remediation of discrimination; promote \n",
       " public and private investment in certain under-served markets, \n",
       " potentially increasing access to mortgage credit; and promote more \n",
       " stable and competitive markets. Quantifying and monetizing these \n",
       " benefits would require identifying all possible uses of HMDA data, \n",
       " establishing causal links to the resulting public benefits, and then \n",
       " quantifying the magnitude of these benefits. The Bureau continues to \n",
       " seek data from available sources regarding the benefits to consumers of \n",
       " the proposed rule. The Bureau is particularly interested in the \n",
       " quantifiable impact of increased transparency on financial institution \n",
       " behavior, the need for public and private investment, the housing needs \n",
       " of communities, the number of lenders potentially engaging in \n",
       " discriminatory or predatory behavior, and the number of consumers \n",
       " currently being unfairly disadvantaged and the level of quantifiable \n",
       " damage from such disadvantage. The Bureau is unaware of data that would \n",
       " enable reliable quantitative estimates of all of these effects.\n",
       "     Similar issues arise in attempting to quantify the benefits to \n",
       " covered persons. Certain benefits to covered persons are difficult to \n",
       " quantify. For example, the Bureau believes that the enhanced HMDA data \n",
       " will facilitate improved monitoring of the mortgage market in order to \n",
       " prevent major disruptions to the financial system, which in turn would \n",
       " benefit financial institutions over the long run. But such effects are \n",
       " hard to quantify because they are largely related to future events that \n",
       " the proposed changes themselves are designed to prevent from happening. \n",
       " Similarly, the Bureau believes that the enhanced HMDA data will provide \n",
       " a better analytical basis for financial regulators and community groups \n",
       " to screen and monitor lenders for possible discrimination. Because of \n",
       " limitations in the current HMDA data fields, high false positive rates \n",
       " have been widely cited by financial institutions in various HMDA-\n",
       " related fair lending exams, complaints, and lawsuits. The proposed \n",
       " changes would greatly reduce the rate of false positives and therefore \n",
       " reduce the associated compliance burden on financial institutions. The \n",
       " Bureau believes that such benefits to financial institutions could be \n",
       " substantial. Nevertheless, quantifying them would require data that are \n",
       " currently unavailable.\n",
       "     In light of these data limitations, the discussion below generally \n",
       " provides a qualitative consideration of the benefits, costs, and \n",
       " impacts of the proposed rule. General economic principles, together \n",
       " with the limited data available, provide insight into these benefits, \n",
       " costs, and impacts. Where possible, the Bureau has made quantitative \n",
       " estimates based on these principles and the data that are available. \n",
       " The Bureau seeks comment on the appropriateness of the approach \n",

       " 1. Overall Summary\n",
       "     In this section, the Bureau presents a concise, high-level overview \n",
       " of the benefits and costs considered in the remainder of the \n",
       " discussion. This overview is not intended to capture all details and \n",
       " nuances that are provided both in the rest of the analysis and in the \n",
       " section-by-section discussion above, but rather to provide an overview \n",
       " of the major benefits and costs of the proposed rule.\n",
       "     Major benefits of the rule. The proposed rule has a number of major \n",
       " benefits. First, the proposed changes will improve the usefulness of \n",
       " HMDA data in identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and \n",
       " enforcing antidiscrimination statutes. By covering additional \n",
       " transactions, including mandatory reporting of open-end lines of \n",
       " credit, home-equity loans, reverse mortgages, and preapproval requests \n",
       " that were approved, but not accepted, and by requiring reporting by \n",
       " additional nondepository institutions, the proposal expands the scope \n",
       " of the market that community groups and government agencies can include \n",
       " in fair lending analyses. The addition of pricing data fields such as \n",
       " interest rate, discount points, and origination charges improves \n",
       " understanding of disparities in pricing outcomes beyond that permitted \n",
       " by the current rate spread data field. The addition of data fields such \n",
       " as CLTV, credit score, DTI, and AUS recommendations allow for a more \n",
       " refined analysis and understanding of disparities in both underwriting \n",
       " and pricing outcomes. Overall, the proposed changes make fair lending \n",
       " analyses more comprehensive and accurate. This is especially important \n",
       " for the prioritization and peer analysis or redlining reviews that \n",
       " regulatory agencies conduct for fair lending supervision and \n",
       " enforcement purposes because a consistent and clean dataset will be \n",
       " available for all financial institutions.\n",
       "     Second, the proposal will help determine whether financial \n",
       " institutions are serving the housing needs of their communities and \n",
       " help public officials target public investment to better attract \n",
       " private investment, two of HMDA's stated purposes. The proposed \n",
       " expansions of institutional and transactional coverage would provide \n",
       " additional data helpful to both industry and government in identifying \n",
       " profitable lending and investment opportunities in underserved \n",
       " communities. Similarly, the proposed data points related to multifamily \n",
       " dwellings and manufactured housing would reveal more information about \n",
       " these segments of the market. Borrowers who seek financing for \n",
       " manufactured housing are typically more financially vulnerable than \n",
       " borrowers financing site-built homes, and may deserve closer attention \n",
       " from government agencies and\n",
       " \n",
       " [[Page 51824]]\n",
       " \n",
       " community groups. Although financing involving multifamily dwellings \n",
       " reported under HMDA is typically offered to institutional borrowers, \n",
       " the ultimate constituents these loans serve are mostly low- to mid-\n",
       " income renters who live in these financed units. Advocacy groups and \n",
       " government agencies have raised concerns over affordability issues \n",
       " faced by individuals living in multifamily dwellings, who also tend to \n",
       " be more financially vulnerable than individuals living in single-family \n",
       " dwellings. Overall, by permitting a better and more comprehensive \n",
       " understanding of these markets, the proposal will improve the \n",
       " usefulness of HMDA data for assessing the supply and demand of credit, \n",
       " and financial institutions' treatment of applicants and borrowers, in \n",
       " these communities.\n",
       "     Third, the proposed changes would assist in earlier identification \n",
       " of trends in the mortgage market including the cyclical loosening and \n",
       " tightening of credit. Mandatory reporting of additional transactions, \n",
       " such as open-end lines of credit, home-equity loans, and reverse \n",
       " mortgages, as well as additional data fields, such as amortization \n",
       " type, prepayment penalty, and occupancy type, would improve \n",
       " understanding of the types of products and product characteristics \n",
       " received by consumers. Recent research has indicated that certain \n",
       " product types and characteristics may have increased the likelihood of \n",
       " default and exacerbated declines in housing prices during the recent \n",
       " financial crisis. In addition to being able to better identify some of \n",
       " the risk factors that played a role in the recent financial crisis, the \n",
       " additional transactions and data points would improve current research \n",
       " efforts to understand mortgage markets. This research may identify new \n",
       " risk factors that might increase systemic risk to the overall economy. \n",
       " Better understanding of these risk factors could provide early warning \n",
       " signals to the government of worrisome market trends.\n",
       "     Fourth, the proposed changes will improve the effectiveness of \n",
       " policy-making efforts. In response to the recent financial crisis, the \n",
       " government has generated a number of rules and implemented a wide array \n",
       " of public policy measures to address market failures and protect \n",
       " consumers. The additional data being proposed, as well as the proposed \n",
       " coverage and transaction changes, will allow for more informed \n",
       " decisions by policy makers and improve the consideration of benefits, \n",
       " costs, and impacts for future policy efforts, resulting in more \n",
       " effective policy.\n",
       "     Quantifying these benefits is difficult because the size of each \n",
       " particular effect cannot be known in advance. Given the number of \n",
       " mortgage transactions and the size of the mortgage market, however, \n",
       " small changes in behavior can have substantial aggregate effects. The \n",
       " Bureau seeks comments and suggestions on whether such effects can be \n",
       " reliably estimated and possible ways of doing so.\n",
       "     Major costs of the rule. The proposed rule will increase ongoing \n",
       " operational costs and impose one-time costs on financial institutions. \n",
       " Financial institutions conduct a variety of operational tasks to \n",
       " collect the necessary data points, prepare the data for submission, \n",
       " conduct compliance and audit checks, and prepare for HMDA-related \n",
       " exams. These operational costs are driven primarily by the time spent \n",
       " on each task and the wage of the relevant employee. The Bureau \n",
       " estimates that current annual operational costs of reporting under HMDA \n",
       " are approximately $2,200 for a representative low-complexity financial \n",
       " institution with a loan application register size of 50 records; \n",
       " $32,000 for a representative moderate-complexity financial institution \n",
       " with a loan application register size of 1,000 records; and $267,000 \n",
       " for a representative high-complexity financial institution with loan \n",
       " application register size of 50,000 records. This translates into an \n",
       " estimated per-application cost of approximately $45, $30, and $5 for \n",
       " representative low-, moderate- and high-complexity financial \n",

       " efforts indicated that many financial institutions, especially larger \n",
       " and more complex institutions, process home-equity products in the \n",
       " consumer business line using separate procedures, policies, and data \n",

       " equity products could be substantial for many financial institutions \n",
       " but so far lacks the data necessary to accurately quantify it. For this \n",
       " discussion, the Bureau assumes that the one-time cost of integrating \n",
       " home-equity products into HMDA reporting processes would be roughly \n",
       " equal to 50 percent of the one-time costs absent mandatory reporting of \n",
       " such products. This estimate accounts for the fact that compliance with \n",
       " the reporting requirements for these lines of business would require \n",
       " some new systems, extra start-up training, and new compliance \n",
       " procedures and manuals, but that some fixed, one-time costs could be \n",
       " shared with lines of business currently subject to Regulation C because \n",
       " both have to undergo systemic changes. For high- and moderate-\n",
       " complexity financial institutions, the Bureau therefore estimates one-\n",
       " time costs to adapt to mandatory reporting of open-end lines of credit, \n",
       " home-equity loans, and reverse mortgages to be $400,000 and $125,000, \n",

       " cost associated with mandatory reporting of dwelling-secured home-\n",
       " equity products is relatively low because these institutions are less \n",
       " reliant on information technology systems for HMDA reporting, and home-\n",
       " equity products are often processed on the same system and in the same \n",
       " business unit as mortgage products. Therefore, for tier 3 financial \n",
       " institutions, the Bureau estimates that the additional one-time cost \n",

       " a continuum that is impossible to fully capture. As a result, the \n",

       "     Based on the outreach described above, the Bureau classified the \n",
       " operational activities that financial institutions currently use for \n",
       " HMDA data collection and reporting into discrete compliance ``tasks.'' \n",
       " This classification consists of 18 ``component tasks,'' which can be \n",

       " classification is intended to facilitate estimation of baseline costs \n",
       " and to enable rigorous analysis of the impact of the proposals across a \n",
       " wide range of financial institutions. The four primary tasks are \n",
       " described briefly below.\n",
       "     1. Data collection: Transcribing data, resolving reportability \n",
       " questions, and transferring data to HMDA Management System (HMS).\n",
       "     2. Reporting and resubmission: Geocoding, standard annual edit and \n",

       " checking post-submission edits, filing post-submission documents, \n",
       " creating public loan application register, distributing public loan \n",

       " external audits.\n",
       "     4. HMDA-related exams: Exam preparation and exam assistance.\n",
       "     In addition to collecting information about operational activities \n",
       " and costs, the Bureau also used outreach efforts and the Small Business \n",
       " Review Panel process to better understand the potential one-time costs \n",
       " that HMDA reporters will incur in response to the proposed rule. \n",
       " Management, legal, and compliance personnel will likely require time to \n",
       " learn new reporting requirements and assess legal and compliance risks. \n",
       " Financial institutions that use vendors for HMDA compliance will incur \n",
       " one-time costs associated with software installation, troubleshooting, \n",
       " and testing. The Bureau is aware that these activities will take time \n",
       " and that the costs may vary depending on the time available. Financial \n",
       " institutions that maintain their own reporting systems will incur one-\n",
       " time costs to develop, prepare, and implement necessary modifications \n",
       " to those systems. In all cases, financial institutions will need to \n",
       " update training materials to reflect new requirements and activities \n",
       " and may have certain one-time costs for providing initial training to \n",
       " current employees.\n",
       "     The Bureau recognizes that the cost per loan of complying with the \n",
       " current requirements of HMDA, as well as the operational and one-time \n",
       " impact of the proposed rule will differ by financial institution. \n",
       " During the Bureau's outreach with financial institutions, the Bureau \n",
       " identified seven key dimensions of compliance operations that were \n",
       " significant drivers of compliance costs. These seven dimensions are: \n",
       " The reporting system used; the degree of system integration; the degree \n",
       " of system automation; the compliance program; and the tools for \n",
       " geocoding, performing completeness checks, and editing. The Bureau \n",
       " found that financial institutions tended to have similar levels of \n",
       " complexity in compliance operations\n",
       " \n",
       " [[Page 51827]]\n",
       " \n",
       " across all seven dimensions. For example, if a given financial \n",
       " institution had less system integration, then it would also tend to use \n",
       " less automation and less-complex tools for geocoding. It was generally \n",
       " not the case that a financial institution would use less complex \n",
       " approaches on one dimension and more complex approaches on another. The \n",
       " small entity representatives validated this perspective during the \n",
       " Small Business Review Panel meeting.\n",
       "     To capture the relationships between operational complexity and \n",
       " compliance cost, the Bureau used these seven dimensions to define three \n",
       " broadly representative lenders according to the overall level of \n",
       " complexity of their compliance operations. Tier 1 denotes a \n",
       " representative financial institution with the highest level of \n",
       " complexity, tier 2 denotes a representative financial institution with \n",
       " a moderate level of complexity, and tier 3 denotes a representative \n",
       " financial institution with the lowest level of complexity. For each \n",
       " tier, the Bureau developed a separate set of assumptions and cost \n",
       " estimates. All of these assumptions and cost estimates apply at the \n",

       " Because financial institutions are arrayed along a continuum of \n",
       " compliance cost that cannot be precisely mapped to three representative \n",
       " tiers, the Bureau has adopted a conservative strategy in providing a \n",

       " Bureau used the total number of reporters (7,421) and the total number \n",
       " of loan application register records (18,723,000) in the 2012 HMDA \n",
       " data.\n",
       "     As a first step, the Bureau identified all possible tier \n",
       " distributions that were consistent with these two reporter and record \n",
       " counts, using the same loan application register sizes adopted in the \n",
       " institutional-level analysis (50,000 for tier 1 institutions; 1,000 for \n",
       " tier 2 institutions; and 50 for tier 3 institutions). Specifically the \n",
       " Bureau set the following two constraints: (1) The total number of HMDA \n",
       " reporters in all three tiers must sum to 7,421; and (2) using the \n",
       " assumed loan application register size in each tier, the total number \n",
       " of loan application register records by all reporters in all three \n",
       " tiers must sum to 18,723,000. For this step, the Bureau imposed an \n",
       " additional constraint by classifying all 217 HMDA reporters with over \n",
       " 10,000 records as tier 1, because the Bureau's investigation led it to \n",
       " believe that these large financial institutions all possess a high \n",
       " level of complexity in HMDA reporting. This assumption helped to narrow \n",
       " the range of possible combinations. The Bureau also substituted the \n",
       " actual loan application register size of these 217 largest HMDA \n",
       " reporters into this constraint for the loan application register size \n",
       " of a tier 1 financial institution, further narrowing the range of \n",
       " possible combinations. The Bureau notes that all distributions \n",
       " identified are mathematically possible based on the Bureau's \n",
       " assumptions.\n",
       "     Second, for the subset of tier distributions satisfying these \n",
       " reporter and count constraints, the Bureau then estimated market-level \n",
       " costs based on the tier-specific assumptions and cost estimates. That \n",
       " is, for a given distribution derived in the first step, the Bureau \n",
       " multiplied the institutional-level cost estimate for each tier by the \n",
       " number of institutions in that tier, and then summed across all three \n",
       " tiers. The distributions with the lowest- and highest-estimated market-\n",
       " level costs provided the lower and upper bounds for the market-level \n",
       " estimates throughout the consideration of the benefits and costs. \n",
       " Specifically, the Bureau arrived at two distributions for all HMDA \n",
       " reporters: (1) The first distribution has 4 percent of financial \n",
       " institutions in tier 1, 0 percent of financial institutions in tier 2, \n",
       " and 96 percent of financial institutions in tier 3; and (2) the second \n",

       " percent of financial institutions in tier 2, and 31 percent of \n",
       " financial institutions in tier 3. The Bureau notes that these two \n",
       " distributions likely do not match the state of the world exactly. \n",
       " Nevertheless, for the set of assumptions described above, these \n",
       " distributions provide upper and lower bounds for the market-level \n",
       " estimates. The Bureau recognizes that this range estimate does not \n",
       " permit perfect precision in estimating the impact of the proposed rule \n",
       " and will refine the range estimate for the final rule to the extent \n",
       " that public comments supplement the Bureau's knowledge. The Bureau \n",

       " nondepository institutions pursuant to its discretionary authority \n",
       " under HMDA section 309(a).\n",
       "     Based on data for 2012 from Call Reports, HMDA, and the NMLSR, the \n",
       " Bureau estimates that these proposed changes would reduce the number of \n",
       " reporting depository institutions by approximately 1,600 and increase \n",
       " the number of reporting nondepository institutions by approximately \n",
       " 450.\\608\\ The exclusion of depository institutions would reduce loan \n",

       " of additional nondepository institutions would add approximately 30,000 \n",
       " records. Expansions or contractions of the number of financial \n",

       " reduction in loan application register volume can be obtained \n",
       " directly from current HMDA data, and are therefore relatively \n",
       " reliable. The number of nondepository institutions that would be \n",

       "     Benefits to consumers. The proposed institutional coverage \n",
       " threshold would have several benefits to consumers. Traditionally, \n",
       " nondepository institutions have been subject to less scrutiny by \n",
       " regulators than depository institutions and little is known about the \n",
       " mortgage lending behavior of nondepository institutions that fall below \n",
       " the current reporting thresholds. By illuminating this part of the \n",
       " mortgage market, the proposed rule would provide regulators, public \n",
       " officials, and members of the public with important information. For \n",
       " example, it is possible that small nondepository institutions are \n",
       " serving particular market segments or populations that would benefit \n",
       " from more oversight by public officials and community groups. This \n",
       " oversight can be enhanced only if more information is revealed about \n",

       " by these nondepository institutions would benefit.\n",
       "     Similarly, expanding coverage among nondepository institutions \n",
       " could improve the processes used to identify possible discriminatory \n",

       " regulators and enforcement agencies use HMDA data in their initial \n",

       " Because many depository and nondepository institutions with similar \n",

       "     Finally, the proposed rule will also improve the ability to \n",

       " States Census, Call Reports, and the NMLSR can be used to characterize \n",
       " the housing needs of the communities each lender serves. HMDA data \n",

       " following five operational steps affect variable costs: Transcribing \n",
       " data, resolving reportability questions, transferring data to an HMS, \n",
       " geocoding, and researching questions. The primary impact of the \n",
       " proposed rule on these operational steps is an increase in time spent \n",
       " per task. Overall, the Bureau estimates that the impact of the proposed \n",
       " rule on variable costs per application is approximately $13 for a \n",
       " representative tier 3 financial institution, $0.20 for a representative \n",
       " tier 2 financial institution, and $0.11 for a representative tier 1 \n",

       " Bureau expects most of them to be tier 3 financial institutions. Hence, \n",
       " based on microeconomics principles, the Bureau expects the costs that a \n",
       " representative financial institution affected by this proposal would \n",
       " pass on to mortgage applicants would be $13 per application. This \n",
       " expense will be amortized over the life of the loan and represents a \n",

       " Bureau does not anticipate any material adverse effect on credit access \n",
       " in the long or short term even if the additional reporting \n",
       " nondepository institutions pass on these costs to consumers.\n",

       "     \\610\\ These cost estimates do not incorporate the impact of \n",
       " adding operational changes affecting geocoding, DES processing, and \n",
       " help sources. Incorporating these additional operational changes \n",
       " would reduce the estimated impact on variable costs. Therefore, the \n",
       " estimates we provided are upper bound estimates of the increase in \n",

       " consumers. These estimates of the impact of the proposed rule on \n",

       " these costs were passed on would depend on the competiveness of the \n",
       " market in which they operate, especially for smaller financial \n",

       " they would attempt to pass on costs through higher fees on other \n",

       " for analyzing mortgage markets by regulators and the public. For \n",
       " example, data points such as non-amortizing features, introductory \n",
       " interest rate, prepayment penalty, and home-equity line of credit \n",
       " indicator are related to certain high-risk lending concerns, and \n",
       " reporting this information will enable a better understanding of the \n",
       " types of products and features consumers are receiving. Recent research \n",
       " has indicated that each of these products and product characteristics \n",
       " have increased likelihoods of default and foreclosure and may have \n",
       " exacerbated the recent housing crisis. In addition to being better able \n",
       " to identify some of the risk factors that played a role in the recent \n",
       " financial crisis, adding additional data points on pricing and \n",
       " underwriting will improve current research efforts to understand \n",
       " mortgage markets. All of these enhancements will allow for improved \n",
       " monitoring of trends in mortgage markets and help identify and prevent \n",
       " problems that could potentially harm consumers and society overall.\n",
       "     Second, the additional data points will improve current policy \n",
       " efforts designed to address various market failures. As discussed \n",
       " previously, the mortgage market is characterized by information \n",
       " asymmetry and this inherent deficiency was made apparent during the \n",
       " financial crisis. In response to the recent financial crisis, the \n",
       " government has pursued a number of policies aimed at regulating the \n",
       " market and protecting consumers. The additional data points being \n",
       " proposed will help inform future policy-making efforts by improving \n",
       " consideration of the benefits and costs associated with various \n",
       " choices, resulting in more effective policy. As an example, many recent \n",
       " regulations have limited the types of risky mortgage products that \n",
       " lenders can make to borrowers without fully considering borrowers' \n",
       " ability to repay. New data fields on non-amortizing features, \n",
       " introductory interest rate, prepayment penalty, debit-to-income ratio, \n",
       " and the qualified mortgage indicator can assist future assessment of \n",
       " the effectiveness of such regulations and facilitate adjustments when \n",
       " needed.\n",
       "     Third, the additional data points will help determine whether \n",
       " financial institutions are serving the housing needs of their \n",
       " communities and help public officials target public investment to \n",
       " better attract private investment. For example, the proposed data \n",
       " points related to manufactured housing would reveal more information \n",
       " about this segment of the market. Borrowers in manufactured housing are \n",
       " typically more financially vulnerable than borrowers in site-built \n",
       " housing and may deserve closer attention from government agencies and \n",
       " community groups. Similarly, the proposed data points related to \n",
       " multifamily dwellings would reveal more information about this segment \n",
       " of the market, which mostly serves low- to mid-income renters who live \n",
       " in these financed units. Advocacy groups and government agencies have \n",
       " raised concerns over affordability issues faced by individuals living \n",
       " in multifamily dwellings, who also tend to be more financially \n",
       " vulnerable. Overall, by permitting a better and more comprehensive \n",
       " understanding of these markets, the proposal will improve the \n",
       " usefulness of HMDA data for assessing the supply and demand of credit, \n",
       " and financial institutions' treatment of applicants and borrowers in \n",
       " these communities.\n",
       "     Fourth, the Bureau believes that the additional data points will \n",
       " improve current processes used to identify possible discriminatory \n",
       " lending patterns and enforce antidiscrimination statutes. Financial \n",
       " regulators and enforcement agencies use HMDA data in their initial \n",
       " prioritization and screening processes to select institutions for \n",
       " examination and as the base dataset during fair lending reviews. The \n",
       " additional data will allow for improved segmentation during these \n",
       " analyses, so that applications are compared to other applications for \n",
       " similar products. For example, underwriting and pricing policies often \n",
       " differ for open-end lines of credit, home-equity loans, reverse \n",
       " mortgages, and products with different amortization types. Currently, \n",
       " these products are all combined during prioritization and screening \n",
       " analyses. With additional data fields identifying these products, \n",
       " separate analyses can be conducted for each product, which will more \n",
       " accurately reflect outcomes for consumers. As a second example, pricing \n",
       " often differs across delivery channels, because pricing policies and \n",
       " processing differ, and because intermediaries, such as brokers, add an \n",
       " additional layer requiring compensation. The addition of the \n",
       " origination channel data point will permit the separation of \n",
       " originations for pricing analyses, allowing for a better understanding \n",
       " of the drivers of pricing outcomes. Improved segmentation improves the \n",
       " accuracy of fair lending analyses, which improves the usefulness of \n",
       " HMDA to identify potentially disadvantaged consumers.\n",
       "     The additional data points on pricing will greatly improve the \n",
       " usefulness of HMDA data for assessing pricing outcomes. Currently, the \n",
       " rate spread data field is the only quantitative pricing measure \n",
       " included in the current HMDA data . This data field includes rate \n",
       " spread data only for higher-priced mortgage loans, which currently \n",
       " comprise less than 5 percent of originated loans in the HMDA data. \n",
       " Thus, in today's environment, and for the foreseeable future, the \n",
       " usefulness of this data field is highly limited. In addition, mortgage \n",
       " products and pricing structure are inherently complex. APR alone, \n",
       " though useful and recognizable to borrowers, fails to capture the true \n",
       " cost of a mortgage loan. Adding discount points, interest rate, and \n",
       " risk-adjusted, pre-discounted interest rate will provide a much clearer \n",
       " understanding of the trade-offs between rates and points that are the \n",
       " foundation of mortgage pricing. The total points and fees and \n",
       " origination-charge data fields will provide a deeper understanding of \n",
       " the third component of mortgage pricing: Fees.\n",
       "     Many of the additional data points capture legitimate factors \n",
       " financial institutions use in underwriting and pricing that are \n",
       " currently lacking in the HMDA data, helping regulators and government \n",
       " enforcement agencies to better understand disparities in outcomes. \n",
       " Many, if not all, lenders consider data points such as credit score, \n",
       " CLTV, DTI, and AUS results when either underwriting or pricing mortgage \n",
       " applications. The addition of\n",
       " \n",
       " [[Page 51841]]\n",
       " \n",
       " these types of data points will help users understand patterns in \n",
       " underwriting and pricing outcomes and thus better assess the fair \n",
       " lending risk presented by those outcomes.\n",

       " \n",
       " [[Page 51848]]\n",
       " \n",

       " mortgage market for a variety of purposes, including general market and \n",
       " economic monitoring, as well as assessing housing needs, public \n",
       " investment, and possible discrimination. Historically, HMDA has been \n",
       " implemented by the Board through Regulation C, 12 CFR part 203. In \n",
       " 2011, the Bureau established a new Regulation C, 12 CFR part 1003, \n",
       " substantially duplicating the Board's Regulation C, making only non-\n",
       " substantive, technical, formatting, and stylistic changes. Congress has \n",
       " periodically modified the law, and the Board routinely updated \n",
       " Regulation C, in order to ensure that the data continued to fulfill \n",
       " HMDA's purposes.\n",
       "     Users of HMDA data, however, have consistently advocated for \n",
       " expansion of HMDA data to keep pace with the mortgage market's \n",
       " evolution, particularly during the market's rapid growth into \n",
       " nontraditional lending products and its subsequent collapse in 2008. In \n",
       " 2010, Congress responded to the mortgage crisis in the Dodd-Frank Act \n",
       " by enacting changes to HMDA as well as directing reforms to the \n",
       " mortgage market and the broader financial system. In addition to \n",

       " reporting of several new data points, and authorized the Bureau to \n",
       " require financial institutions to collect and report such other \n",
       " information as the Bureau may require.\n",

       " 2. Succinct Statement of the Objectives of, and Legal Basis for, the \n",
       " Proposed Rule\n",
       "     This rulemaking has multiple objectives. First, the proposed rule \n",
       " is designed to improve the usefulness of HMDA data for determining \n",
       " whether institutions are serving the housing needs of their \n",
       " communities, identifying potentially discriminatory lending patterns \n",
       " and enforcing antidiscrimination laws, and helping public officials \n",
       " target public investment so as to attract private investment to areas \n",
       " where it is needed. To achieve these objectives, the proposed rule \n",
       " requires financial institutions to report additional information \n",
       " regarding originations and applications of mortgage loans, and makes \n",
       " several modifications to the institutional and transactional coverage \n",
       " of Regulation C. To improve the quality and timeliness of HMDA data, \n",
       " the Bureau is also proposing to require financial institutions with \n",
       " large numbers of reported transactions to submit their HMDA data on a \n",
       " quarterly, rather than an annual, basis.\n",
       "     The Bureau also intends for the proposal to reduce unnecessary \n",
       " burden on financial institutions. To this end, the Bureau is proposing \n",
       " to adjust Regulation C's institutional coverage test to simplify the \n",
       " institutional coverage requirements by adopting, for all financial \n",
       " institutions, a uniform loan-volume threshold of 25 loans. The proposed \n",
       " rule would also increase the clarity of the regulation by, among other \n",
       " things, modifying the definitions of certain ambiguous terms, adopting \n",
       " certain new definitions, and consolidating the list of exempt \n",
       " institutions and excluded transactions in the same section. Under the \n",
       " proposed regulation, financial institutions would make available to the \n",
       " public a modified loan application register showing only the data \n",
       " fields that are currently released on the modified loan application \n",
       " register, and financial institutions would be permitted to direct \n",
       " members of the public to a publicly available Web site to obtain their \n",
       " disclosure statements. Finally, the proposed rule would modernize and \n",
       " streamline the manner in which financial institutions collect and \n",
       " report HMDA data. Among other things, the Bureau is proposing to align \n",
       " the data requirements with the widely-used MISMO data standards to the \n",
       " extent practicable, and is separately considering various improvements \n",
       " to the HMDA data submission process, such as moving the HMDA data entry \n",
       " software to the Web and restructuring the geocoding process.\n",
       "     As described above, the Dodd-Frank Act transferred to the Bureau \n",
       " the ``consumer financial protection functions'' previously vested in \n",
       " certain other Federal agencies, and authorized the Bureau to prescribe \n",
       " rules necessary or appropriate to administer and carry out the purposes \n",
       " and objectives of the Federal consumer financial laws, and to prevent \n",
       " evasions thereof, including HMDA. As amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, \n",
       " HMDA section 305(a) broadly authorizes the Bureau to prescribe such \n",
       " regulations as may be necessary to carry out HMDA's purposes. These \n",
       " regulations can include ``classifications, differentiations, or other \n",
       " provisions, and may provide for such adjustments and exceptions for any \n",
       " class of transactions, as in the judgment of the Bureau are necessary \n",
       " and proper to effectuate the purposes of [HMDA], and prevent \n",
       " circumvention or evasion thereof, or to facilitate compliance \n",
       " therewith.'' HMDA section 304 requires itemization of specified \n",
       " categories of information, including information about borrowers and \n",
       " loan features and pricing, as well as ``such other information as the \n",
       " Bureau may require.'' Finally, HMDA also grants the Bureau authority \n",
       " over the formats required for compilation and public disclosure of HMDA \n",
       " data, the format required for disclosure to the Bureau or other Federal \n",
       " agencies, and the improvement of methods of matching addresses and \n",

       "     Benefits to small entities. HMDA is a data reporting statute, so \n",
       " all provisions of the proposed rule affect reporting requirements. \n",
       " Overall, the proposed rule has several potential benefits for small \n",
       " entities. First, the proposed revision to the institutional coverage \n",
       " criteria, which imposes a loan volume threshold of 25 loans, excluding \n",
       " open-end lines of credit, applicable to all financial institutions, \n",
       " would benefit depository institutions that are not significantly \n",
       " involved in originating dwelling-secured loans. The Bureau expects that \n",
       " most of these depository institutions are small entities. These \n",
       " depository institutions would no longer have to report under HMDA and \n",
       " would no longer have to incur current operational costs, or the \n",
       " increase in operational cost and the one-time costs, created by the \n",
       " proposed rule.\n",
       "     Second, the proposed revisions to the transactional coverage \n",
       " criteria would eliminate reporting of unsecured home improvement loans. \n",
       " The Bureau believes most small entities will be comparable to the \n",
       " representative tier 3 institution based on the Bureau's assumptions \n",
       " discussed extensively in part VI.E of this supplementary information, \n",
       " and that the volume of applications for unsecured home improvement \n",
       " loans for these financial institutions is small. Therefore, the benefit \n",
       " from this change will be small for most small entities. However, some \n",
       " small entities may receive larger volumes of applications for unsecured \n",
       " home improvement products, and the benefit will be larger for these \n",
       " financial institutions.\n",
       "     Third, the proposed revisions requiring mandatory reporting of all \n",
       " home-equity lines of credit, home-equity loans, reverse mortgages, and \n",
       " preapproval requests that have been approved but not accepted, combined \n",
       " with the additional data points being proposed, will improve the \n",
       " prioritization process that regulators and enforcement agencies use to \n",
       " identify institutions with higher fair lending risk. During \n",
       " prioritization analyses, the additional transactions and data points \n",
       " will allow for improved segmentation, so that applications are compared \n",
       " to other applications for similar products. In addition, the data \n",
       " points will add to the legitimate factors used in underwriting and \n",
       " pricing that are currently lacking in the HMDA data, helping regulators \n",
       " and government enforcement agencies better understand disparities in \n",
       " outcomes. These improvements will reduce false positives that occur \n",
       " when inadequate information causes lenders with low fair lending risk \n",
       " to be initially misidentified as having high-risk. The additional \n",
       " information on these products and data points will explain some of \n",
       " these false positives, so that examination resources can be used more \n",
       " efficiently and lenders with low fair lending risk receive a reduced \n",
       " level of regulatory scrutiny. For small entities currently receiving \n",
       " regulatory oversight, this could greatly reduce the burden from fair \n",
       " lending examinations and enforcement actions.\n",
       "     Fourth, incorporating into the proposed rule alignment of current \n",
       " HMDA data fields with industry data standards provides a benefit to \n",
       " small entities. The Bureau believes that the burden associated with \n",
       " Regulation C compliance and data submission can be reduced by aligning \n",
       " to the extent practicable the requirements of Regulation C to existing \n",
       " industry standards for collecting and transmitting data on mortgage \n",
       " loans and applications. The Bureau believes that promoting consistent \n",
       " data standards for both industry and regulatory use has benefits for \n",
       " market efficiency, market understanding, and market oversight. The \n",
       " efficiencies achieved by aligning HMDA data with widely used industry \n",
       " data standards should grow over time. Specific to small entities, \n",
       " outreach efforts have determined that aligning HMDA with industry data \n",
       " standards will reduce costs for training and researching questions.\n",
       "     Finally, the proposed additional fields will improve the usefulness \n",
       " of HMDA data for analyzing mortgage markets by the regulators and the \n",
       " public. For instance, data points such as non-amortizing features, \n",
       " introductory interest rate, and prepayment penalty that are commonly \n",
       " related to higher risk lending will provide a better understanding of \n",
       " the types of products and features consumers are receiving. This will \n",
       " allow for improved monitoring of trends in mortgage markets and help \n",
       " identify problems that could potentially harm consumers and society \n",
       " overall. Lowering the likelihood of future financial crises benefits \n",
       " all financial institutions, including small entities.\n",
       "     Costs to small entities. The proposed revision to the coverage \n",
       " criteria raises the reporting threshold for depository institutions \n",
       " from 1 to 25 originations and lowers the reporting thresholds for \n",
       " nondepository institutions from 100 to 25 originations. The Bureau \n",
       " expects most of the affected nondepository institutions to be small \n",
       " entities. The additional nondepository institutions that would now be \n",
       " required to report under HMDA would incur one-time start-up costs to \n",
       " develop the necessary reporting infrastructure, as well as the ongoing \n",
       " operational costs to report.\n",
       "     The proposed revisions to transaction coverage would make reporting \n",
       " of open-end lines of credit mandatory, rather than optional; require \n",
       " reporting of all home-equity loans, not just those to be used for home \n",
       " purchase, refinancing, or home improvement; and require reporting of \n",
       " all reverse mortgages. These additional reporting requirements would \n",

       " current and proposed data points to industry data standards to the \n",
       " extent practicable. The additional data points will increase ongoing \n",
       " operational costs, and impose one-time costs as small entities modify \n",

       " external audits.\n",
       "     4. HMDA-related exams: Exam preparation and exam assistance.\n",
       "     All these tasks are related to the preparation of reports or \n",
       " records and most of them are performed by compliance personnel in the \n",
       " compliance department of financial institutions. For some financial\n",
       " \n",
       " [[Page 51852]]\n",
       " \n",
       " institutions, however, the data intake and transcribing stage could \n",
       " involve loan officers or processors whose primary function is to \n",
       " evaluate or process loan applications. For example, the loan officers \n",
       " would take in government monitoring information from the applicants and \n",
       " input that information into the reporting system. However, the Bureau \n",
       " believes that such roles generally do not require any additional \n",
       " professional skills related to recordkeeping or other compliance \n",
       " requirements of this proposed rule that are not otherwise required \n",
       " during the ordinary course of business for small entities.\n",
       "     The type of professional skills required for compliance varies \n",
       " depending on the particular task involved. For example, data \n",
       " transcribing requires data entry skills. Transferring data to an HMS \n",
       " and using vendor HMS software requires knowledge of computer systems \n",
       " and the ability to use them. Researching and resolving reportability \n",
       " questions requires a more complex understanding of the regulatory \n",
       " requirements and the details of the relevant line of business. \n",
       " Geocoding requires skills in using the geocoding software, web systems, \n",
       " or, in cases where geocoding is difficult, knowledge of the local area \n",
       " in which the property is located. Standard annual editing, internal \n",
       " checks, and post-submission editing require knowledge of the relevant \n",
       " data systems, data formats, and HMDA regulatory requirements in \n",
       " addition to skills in quality control and assurance. Filing post-\n",
       " submission documents, creating public loan application registers, and \n",
       " distributing public loan application registers and disclosure reports \n",
       " requires skills in information creation, dissemination, and \n",
       " communication. Training, internal audits, and external audits requires \n",
       " communications skills, educational skills, and regulatory knowledge. \n",
       " HMDA-related exam preparation and exam assistance involve knowledge of \n",
       " regulatory requirements, the relevant line of business, and the \n",
       " relevant data systems.\n",
       "     The Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code has compliance \n",
       " officers listed under code 13-1041. The Bureau believes that most of \n",
       " the skills required for preparation of the reports or records related \n",
       " to this proposal are the skills required for job functions performed in \n",
       " this occupation. However, the Bureau recognizes that under this general \n",
       " occupational code there is a high level of heterogeneity in the type of \n",
       " skills required as well as the corresponding labor costs incurred by \n",
       " the financial institutions performing these functions.\n",
       "     During the SBREFA process, some small entity representatives noted \n",
       " that due to the small size of their institutions, they do not have \n",
       " separate compliance departments exclusively dedicated to HMDA \n",
       " compliance. Their HMDA compliance personnel are often engaged in other \n",
       " corporate compliance functions. To the extent that the compliance \n",
       " personnel of a small entity are divided between HMDA compliance and \n",
       " other functions, the skills required for those personnel may differ \n",
       " from the skills required for fully-dedicated HMDA compliance personnel. \n",
       " For instance, some small entity representatives noted that high-level \n",
       " corporate officers such as CEOs and senior vice presidents could be \n",
       " directly involved in some HMDA tasks. The Bureau seeks comment \n",
       " regarding the skills required for the preparation of the reports or \n",
       " records related to this proposed rule.\n",
       "     Due to the proposed changes, the Bureau acknowledges the \n",
       " possibility that certain aspects of the proposed rule may require some \n",
       " small entities to hire additional compliance staff. The Bureau has no \n",
       " evidence that such additional staff will possess a qualitatively \n",
       " different set of professional skills than small entity staff employed \n",
       " currently for HMDA purposes. It is possible, however, that compliance \n",
       " with the proposed rule may emphasize certain skills. For example, \n",
       " additional data points may increase demand for skills involved in \n",
       " researching questions, standard annual editing, and post-submission \n",
       " editing. On the other hand, the Bureau is separately considering \n",
       " operational enhancements and modifications to alleviate some of the \n",
       " compliance burden. For example, the Bureau is considering working to \n",
       " consolidate the outlets for assistance, providing guidance support \n",
       " similar to the guidance provided for Title XIV rules; improving points \n",
       " of contact processes for help inquiries; modifying the types of edits \n",
       " and when edits are approved; exploring opportunities to improve the \n",
       " current DES; and considering approaches to reduce geocoding burdens. \n",
       " Such enhancements may also change the relative composition of HMDA \n",
       " compliance personnel and the skills involved in recording and reporting \n",
       " data. Nevertheless, the Bureau believes that compliance would still \n",
       " involve the general set of skills identified above.\n",
       "     The recordkeeping and reporting requirements associated with this \n",
       " proposal would also involve skills for information technology system \n",
       " development, integration, and maintenance. Financial institutions often \n",
       " use the HMS for HMDA purpose. HMS could be developed by the institution \n",
       " internally or purchased from a third-party vendor. Under the proposed \n",
       " rule, the Bureau anticipates that most of these systems would need \n",
       " substantial upgrades to comply with the proposed requirements. It is \n",
       " possible that other systems used by financial institutions, such as \n",
       " loan origination systems, might also need upgrades to be compatible \n",
       " with the upgraded HMS. The professional skills required for this one-\n",
       " time upgrade would be related to software development, testing, system \n",
       " engineering, information technology project management, budgeting and \n",
       " operation.\n",
       "     Based on feedback from the small entity representatives, many small \n",
       " business HMDA reporters rely on FFIEC DES tools and do not use a \n",
       " dedicated HMS. The Bureau is separately considering upgrades to the \n",
       " HMDA DES, such as moving DES to the web, which would allow financial \n",
       " institutions to use the software from multiple terminals in different \n",
       " branches and might reduce the required information technology \n",

       " legal and compliance risks. Financial institutions that use vendors for \n",

       " these activities will require time and that the costs may be sensitive \n",
       " to the time available for them. Financial institutions that maintain \n",
       " their own reporting systems will incur one-time costs to develop, \n",
       " prepare, and implement necessary modifications to those systems. In all \n",
       " cases, financial institutions will need to update training materials to \n",
       " reflect new requirements and activities and may have certain one-time \n",
       " costs for providing initial training to current employees.\n",
       "     For current HMDA reporters, the Bureau estimates that the proposed \n",
       " rule will impose on average one-time costs of $3,000 for tier 3 \n",
       " financial institutions, $250,000 for tier 2 financial institutions and \n",
       " $800,000 for tier 1 financial institutions without considering the \n",

       " and reverse mortgages.\\686\\ Including the estimated one-time costs to \n",

       " 1 institutions. This yields an overall estimated market impact of \n",
       " between $383,000,000 and $2,100,000,000. Using a 7 percent discount \n",
       " rate and a five-year window, the annualized one-time, additional cost \n",
       " is $93,400,000 to $514,900,000. The Bureau expects to obtain more \n",

       " a continuum that is impossible to fully capture. As a result, the \n",

       " not reporting under HMDA to begin reporting. These nondepository \n",
       " institutions will incur start-up costs to develop policies and \n",
       " procedures, infrastructure, and training. Based on outreach discussions \n",

       " the term for identifying the comparable transaction is the initial, \n",
       " fixed-rate period (i.e., the period until the first scheduled rate \n",
       " adjustment). For example, five years is the relevant term for a \n",
       " variable-rate transaction with a five-year, fixed-rate introductory \n",

       " using the shorter loan term. For example, for a loan term of ten \n",
       " years and three months, the relevant term is ten years; for a loan \n",

       " executed (for example, because the borrower exercises a float-down \n",
       " option or the agreement expires), then the relevant date is the date \n",
       " the financial institution exercises discretion in setting the rate \n",

       " subsequently changes to another program that is subject to different \n",
       " pricing terms, and the financial institution changes the rate \n",

       " SUMMARY: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to adjust \n",
       " certain immigration and naturalization benefit request fees charged by \n",
       " U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). USCIS conducted a \n",
       " comprehensive fee review, after refining its cost accounting process, \n",
       " and determined that current fees do not recover the full costs of the \n",
       " services it provides. Adjustment to the fee schedule is necessary to \n",
       " fully recover costs for USCIS services and to maintain adequate \n",
       " service. DHS proposes to increase USCIS fees by a weighted average of \n",
       " 21 percent and add one new fee. In addition, DHS proposes to clarify \n",
       " that persons filing a benefit request may be required to appear for \n",
       " biometrics services or an interview and pay the biometrics services \n",
       " fee, and make a number of other changes.\n",

       "     DHS proposes to adjust its fee schedule, which specifies the amount \n",
       " of the fee charged for each immigration and naturalization benefit \n",
       " request. The fee schedule was last adjusted on November 23, 2010. See \n",
       " 75 FR 58962 (Sept. 24, 2010) (final rule) (FY 2010/2011 Fee Rule).\n",
       "     U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is primarily \n",
       " funded by immigration and naturalization benefit request fees charged \n",
       " to applicants and petitioners. Fees collected from individuals and \n",
       " entities filing immigration benefit requests are deposited into the \n",
       " Immigration Examinations Fee Account (IEFA) and used to fund the cost \n",
       " of processing immigration benefit requests.\n",
       "     In accordance with the requirements and principles of the Chief \n",
       " Financial Officers Act of 1990, 31 U.S.C. 901-03, (CFO Act), and Office \n",
       " of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-25, USCIS reviews the fees \n",
       " deposited into the IEFA biennially and, if necessary, proposes \n",
       " adjustments to ensure recovery of costs necessary to meet national \n",
       " security, customer service, and adjudicative processing goals. USCIS \n",
       " completed a biennial fee review for FY 2016/2017 in 2015. The results \n",
       " indicate that current fee levels are insufficient to recover the full \n",
       " cost of activities funded by the IEFA.\n",
       "     USCIS calculates its fees to recover the full cost of USCIS \n",
       " operations, which do not include the limited appropriated funds \n",
       " provided by Congress. USCIS anticipates if it continues to operate at \n",
       " current fee levels, it will experience an average annual shortfall of \n",
       " $560 million between IEFA revenues and costs. This projected shortfall \n",
       " poses a risk of degrading USCIS operations funded by IEFA revenue. The \n",
       " proposed rule would eliminate this risk by ensuring full cost recovery. \n",
       " DHS proposes to adjust fees by a weighted average increase of 21 \n",
       " percent. The weighted average increase is the percentage difference \n",
       " between the current and proposed fees by immigration benefit type.\\5\\ \n",
       " USCIS discusses the overall increase proposed in this rule in terms of \n",
       " weighted average, as opposed to a straight average, because the figure \n",
       " represents a more accurate depiction of the overall effect that this \n",

       " ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
       " \n",
       "     \\5\\ USCIS uses weighted average as opposed to a straight average \n",

       " the resulting effect on fee revenue. See the FY 2016/2017 \n",
       " Immigration Examinations Fee Account Fee Review Supporting \n",
       " Documentation for further information. The 21% weighted average \n",

       " for a form that currently requires a fee as compared to the average \n",
       " that would have to be paid per form as proposed in this rule. The \n",
       " sum of the current fees multiplied by the projected FY 2016/2017 fee \n",
       " paying receipts by immigration benefit type, divided by the total \n",
       " fee paying receipts = $332. The sum of the proposed fees multiplied \n",
       " by the projected FY 2016/2017 receipts by immigration benefit type, \n",

       " ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
       " \n",
       "     In addition to ensuring that fees for each specific benefit type \n",
       " are adequate to cover the USCIS costs associated with administering the \n",
       " benefit, the weighted average increase of 21 percent also accounts for \n",
       " USCIS costs for services that are not directly fee funded. For \n",

       " users),\\7\\ and the Office of Citizenship \\8\\ through the use of fees. \n",
       " The proposed fee schedule also accounts for increased costs to \n",

       " accommodate an anticipated increase in the refugee admissions ceiling \n",
       " to 100,000 for FY 2017. This is an increase of 30,000, or 43 percent, \n",

       " \n",
       "     When conducting a fee review, USCIS reviews its recent cost \n",
       " history, operating environment, and current service levels to determine \n",
       " the appropriate method to assign costs to particular benefit requests. \n",
       " The methodology used in the review reflects a robust capability to \n",
       " calculate, analyze, and project costs and revenues.\n",
       "     USCIS uses commercially available ABC software to create financial \n",
       " models to calculate the costs for processing immigration benefit \n",
       " requests, including the costs for biometric services. Following the FY \n",
       " 2010/2011 Fee Rule, USCIS identified several key methodology changes to \n",
       " improve the accuracy of its ABC model, as discussed in the \n",
       " ``Methodology for the 2016/2017 Fee Review'' section in the Supporting \n",
       " Documentation. USCIS continues to update the ABC model with the most \n",
       " current information for fee review and cost management purposes.\n",
       " \n",
       " A. Background\n",
       " \n",
       "     ABC is a business management tool that assigns resource costs to \n",
       " operational activities and then to products and services. These \n",
       " assignments provide an accurate cost assessment of each work stream \n",
       " involved in producing the individual outputs of an agency or \n",
       " organization. The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) \n",
       " notes that ABC helps improve product costing by avoiding arbitrary \n",
       " indirect cost allocation and enables USCIS to conform to Managerial \n",
       " Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards for the Federal Government.\\39\\\n",

       " 1. ABC Methodology\n",
       "     DHS has included FY 2016/2017 Fee Review Supporting Documentation, \n",
       " including a detailed report on how it calculated the fee schedule \n",
       " proposed in the docket for this rulemaking. Comments are welcome on the \n",
       " supporting documentation and all aspects of this proposal. A summary of \n",
       " the fee study, calculations, methodology and conclusions follows.\n",
       " a. Resources\n",
       "     Resources equal the projected FY 2016/2017 annual cost baseline of \n",
       " $3.0 billion. USCIS designed the ABC model structure for FY 2016/2017 \n",
       " to resemble the structure of the FY 2015 annual operating plan. That \n",
       " plan is the detailed budget execution plan USCIS establishes at the \n",
       " beginning of the fiscal year consistent with the approved fiscal year \n",
       " spending authority and forecasted fee revenue.\n",
       " b. Resource Drivers and Resource Assignment\n",
       "     ABC uses resource drivers to assign resources to activities. (See \n",
       " Section VI.A.1.c. of this preamble for more information.) All resource \n",
       " costs are assigned to activities, so the total resources in the model \n",
       " equal the total cost of activities.\n",
       "     A common resource driver in ABC is the number of employees in an \n",
       " organization and the percentage of time they spend performing various \n",
       " activities. The FY 2016/2017 ABC model uses employee counts and \n",
       " activity information to assign resources to activities. USCIS refers to \n",
       " this process as the payroll title analysis. The payroll title analysis \n",
       " determines how employees contribute to the eleven activities in the fee \n",
       " review. When an office engages in more than one activity, USCIS uses \n",
       " operational information to prorate that office's time to multiple \n",
       " activities. Historical activity information is applied to projected \n",
       " staffing levels in FY 2016/2017. The ABC model assigns resources to \n",
       " activities using anticipated staffing levels and historical activity \n",
       " information from the payroll title analysis for each office.\n",
       "     USCIS assigns some costs directly to activities. For example, the \n",
       " contract awarded to support USCIS Application Support Center operations \n",
       " only pertains to the ``Perform Biometric Services'' activity. \n",
       " Therefore, the costs of this contract are assigned directly to this \n",
       " activity. Other overhead costs, including costs for the Office of \n",
       " Information Technology, service-level agreements, and USCIS \n",
       " contributions to the DHS working capital fund are prorated to each \n",
       " office based on the number of authorized positions in those offices, so \n",
       " that each office pays a proportionate share.\n",
       "     The allocation methods in the FY 2016/2017 review are in line with \n",
       " FASAB's Standard 4 on managerial cost accounting concepts. This \n",
       " fulfills the guideline for agencies to directly trace costs when \n",
       " feasible and to either assign costs on a cause-and-effect basis or \n",
       " allocate them in a reasonable and consistent way. Statement of Federal \n",
       " Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) 4, No. 126.\n",
       " c. Activities\n",
       "     In ABC, activities are the critical link between resources and cost \n",
       " objects. Activities represent work performed by an organization. USCIS \n",
       " allocates projected FY 2016/2017 operating costs (resources) to the \n",

       " in a manner that could undermine the transformation process. See \n",

       " online, the agency may collect fees for requests that do not have a \n",
       " form number or do not have the same form number as described in \n",
       " regulations. This could occur, for example, if USCIS developed an \n",
       " online version of a request that individuals often submit with \n",
       " applications for employment authorization. In this situation, USCIS may \n",
       " find it best to consolidate the two requests without separately \n",
       " labelling the different sections pursuant to the relevant form numbers. \n",
       " DHS would still collect the required fee for the underlying benefit \n",
       " request as well as the request for employment authorization, but the \n",
       " actual online request would not necessarily contain form numbers \n",
       " corresponding to each separate request.\n",
       "     Likewise, if USCIS determines that efficiency and customer service \n",
       " would be improved by breaking paper Form I-131 into separate paper \n",
       " forms (for instance, USCIS could institute a separate form and form \n",
       " number for advance parole, humanitarian parole, parole in place, \n",
       " refugee travel documents, reentry permits, or boarding documents), \n",
       " USCIS could do so and continue to charge the Form I-131 fee that is \n",

       " 3. Fee Waivers\n",
       "     USCIS may waive the fee for certain immigration benefit requests \n",
       " when the individual requesting the benefit is unable to pay the fee. \n",
       " See 8 CFR 103.7(c). To request a fee waiver, the individual must submit \n",
       " a written waiver request for permission to have their benefit request \n",
       " processed without payment. The waiver request must state the person's \n",
       " belief that he or she is entitled to or deserving of the benefit \n",
       " requested, the reasons for his or her inability to pay, and evidence to \n",
       " support the reasons indicated. See 8 CFR 103.7(c)(2). There is no \n",
       " appeal of the denial of a fee waiver request. See id. Before 2007, \n",
       " USCIS could waive any fee, even where the fee waiver would be \n",
       " inconsistent with the underlying benefit request. For example, prior to \n",
       " 2007, USCIS could waive fees for companies seeking to sponsor foreign \n",
       " workers; individuals seeking status based on substantial business \n",
       " investments; or individuals seeking to sponsor foreign relatives to \n",
       " whom the sponsors must provide a financial safety net. See 72 FR 4912. \n",
       " Since 2007, however, DHS has limited the USCIS fees that may be waived \n",

       " each filing organization including the name, Employer Identification \n",
       " Number, city, state, ZIP code, and number/type of filings. Each entity \n",
       " may make multiple filings; for instance, there were 482,190 Form I-129 \n",
       " petitions, but only 84,490 unique entities that filed those petitions. \n",
       " Since the filing statistics do not contain information such as the \n",
       " revenue of the business, USCIS looked for this information by \n",
       " researching databases from third-party sources. USCIS used the \n",

       " determine an organization's small entity status and apply Small \n",

       "     USCIS devised a methodology to conduct the small entity analysis \n",

       " form. To achieve a 95 percent confidence level and a 5 percent \n",
       " confidence interval on a population of 84,490 unique entities for Form \n",
       " I-129, USCIS used the standard statistical formula to determine a \n",

       " experience, USCIS expected to find about 40 to 50 percent of the filing \n",
       " organizations in the online subscription and public databases. \n",
       " Accordingly, USCIS selected a sample size approximately 40 percent \n",
       " larger than the minimum necessary in order to allow for non-matches \n",
       " (filing organizations that could not be found in any of the four \n",
       " databases). Therefore, USCIS conducted searches on 534 randomly \n",
       " selected entities from the population of 84,490 unique entities for \n",
       " Form I-129.\n",
       "     The 534 searches for Form I-129 resulted in 404 instances where the \n",
       " name of the filing organization was successfully matched in the \n",
       " databases and 130 instances where the name of the filing organization \n",
       " was not found in the databases. Based on previous experience conducting \n",
       " regulatory flexibility analyses, USCIS assumes filing organizations not \n",
       " found in the online database are likely to be small entities. Thus, in \n",
       " order not to underestimate the number of small entities affected by \n",
       " this rule, USCIS makes the conservative assumption to consider all of \n",
       " the non-matched entities as small entities for the purpose of this \n",
       " analysis. Among the 404 matches for Form I-129, 287 were determined to \n",

       " their North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code. \n",
       " Combining non-matches (130), matches missing data (27), and small \n",
       " entity matches (287), enables us to classify 444 of the 534 entities as \n",

       "     With an aggregated total of 444 out of a sample size of 534, DHS \n",
       " inferred that a majority, or 83.1 percent, of the entities filing Form \n",
       " I-129 petitions during the period were small entities. Furthermore, 284 \n",

       " that USCIS is able to recover the full costs of the immigration \n",
       " services it provides and maintain adequate service. In addition to \n",
       " increasing fees, USCIS proposes the following amendments: provisions \n",
       " that USCIS will reject an immigration benefit request paid with a \n",
       " dishonored check; provisions that USCIS will reject an application that \n",
       " does not include the required biometric services fee; the institution \n",

       " of check or other financial instrument) that is subsequently returned \n",
       " as not payable.\\88\\ Current regulations provide that when a check or \n",
       " other financial instrument used to pay a filing fee is subsequently \n",
       " returned as not payable, the remitter will be notified and requested to \n",
       " pay the filing fee and associated service charge within 14 calendar \n",
       " days, without extension.\\89\\ If the benefit request is pending and \n",
       " these charges are not paid within 14 days, the benefit request will be \n",
       " rejected as improperly filed. In addition, a receipt issued by a DHS \n",
       " officer for any remittance will not be binding upon DHS if the \n",
       " remittance is found uncollectable, and legal and statutory deadlines \n",
       " will not be deemed to have been met if payment is not made within 10 \n",
       " business days after notification by DHS of the dishonored check.\\90\\ In \n",
       " accordance with these provisions, when a payment is returned as not \n",
       " payable, USCIS places the immigration benefit request on hold, and \n",
       " suspends adjudication. If the check was dishonored or payment fails, \n",
       " USCIS assesses a $30 penalty and pursues the unpaid fee and penalty \n",

       "     For applicants, filing fees are a required and fundamental aspect \n",
       " of the benefit being requested. By providing a 14-day window to correct \n",
       " for dishonored checks, the regulation currently permits a benefit \n",
       " request paid with a dishonored payment instrument to secure a place in \n",
       " line ahead of a benefit request that was accompanied by a proper \n",
       " payment, for what may be a time sensitive or numerically limited \n",
       " program. In all cases, rejected filings may be refiled immediately with \n",
       " the proper payment but there are some slight differences depending upon \n",
       " if the submission is paper-based or electronically filed. The USCIS \n",
       " online filing system will permit the rejected applications to remain \n",
       " accessible for the applicant to print and view. The original rejected \n",
       " electronic submission would not be available for resubmission with a \n",

       " rejected submission is paper-based, the entire application/petition/\n",
       " request and supporting documentation are returned and can generally be \n",
       " refiled with the proper payment instrument.\n",
       "     The proposed amendments will provide several benefits to USCIS. \n",
       " First, USCIS currently clears payment checks via the ACH by converting \n",
       " checks to electronic payments. Because USCIS converts checks into ACH \n",
       " payments, there is currently little or no delay before USCIS knows \n",
       " whether the check is valueless. Thus, unlike in the past, USCIS would \n",
       " not begin adjudication until the check has cleared. USCIS benefits by \n",
       " streamlining the process for adjudicators to only begin work on those \n",
       " applications with properly filed fees, eliminating the need to hold \n",
       " applications. USCIS anticipates this streamlined process would help \n",
       " adjudicators to more efficiently process cases without the need to wait \n",
       " on payments. This change in process also provides parity to those \n",
       " applicants who file an application with the correct fees. In addition, \n",
       " the proposed amendments would lower USCIS administrative costs for \n",
       " holding and tracking applications and payments. The holding and \n",
       " tracking of applications requires physical storage space that would no \n",
       " longer be required with the proposed revisions. USCIS currently incurs \n",
       " administrative costs through tracking payments in postage costs and \n",
       " adjudicator time among other costs. USCIS recognizes the unique \n",
       " situation that these proposed changes may have on H-1B lottery \n",
       " regulations, which allow numbers available to petitions in the order in \n",
       " which the petitions are filed.\\98\\ The H-1B lottery regulations allow \n",
       " the final receipt date to be any of the first 5 business days on which \n",
       " petitions subject to the applicable numerical limit may be received. \n",
       " USCIS then will randomly apply all of the numbers among the petitions \n",
