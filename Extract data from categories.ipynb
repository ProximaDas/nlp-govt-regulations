In my case, I share a dock with my \\nneighbor and have been doing so for 20 years.  Sharing costs! \\n I have continued to maintain the right to build my own dock by making permit \\npayments.   I will be building my own dock within the coming year. \\n\\nWith our BOR staff already stretched so thin in our area, who are they going to \\nassign the task of policing the use of the docks?

First and most importantly,  I would like to Thank-You for your open \\nmindedness, your hard work, and time.  Having said that, it seems to me that the \\nadjacent landowners make better friends then enemies.  If no understandings and \\nco-operations are the way of the future and of these new rules, which I might add, \\nsome of which would be hard to enforce and are expensive, we the landowners \\nwould have act just like the public, for example, slide down the embankments\\n(cliffs), having no regard for this fire hazzard no man\\'s land between the lake and \\nourselves, and that we the landowners who cares for more than anyone including \\nthe BOR. of and for this land.

But now, the dock \\nFees on the other hand, are highway robbery and punitive at the least.  The Fees \\nare wrong and truly unfair!   All this new policy--rules etc...  will make for the most \\nuncooperative neighbors than ever! We landowners, would vote for friendships and \\nhelp the BOR. Otherwise, what is the BOR\\'s real motives here??   Please, Mr. \\nRizzi, consider the above, I being a disabled person, find it most theraputical, the \\nability to get down a simple set of stairs to my very expensive dock and then sit \\nand enjoy what little I am able.

If they were major repairs or if \\nreplacement of a dock or even a section of a dock was required it could take even \\nlonger than that because of the limited availability of qualified contractors, not to \\nmention the fact that these types of repairs are always very expensive and it may \\ntake some time to make financial arrangements to pay for the repairs.\\nIt is my feeling that you are trying to be fair with your regulation and a (minimum)  \\ntime of 180 days would be more realistic and fair.

In addition, they should be \\ngiven an opportunity to correct any problem that has lead to the BOR’s desire to \\nterminate that use.

I wish to comment on the proposed \\nrevised changes regarding local control for lesser forms of public use.\\n\\nBoat docks should be defined as lesser forms of private use and regulated under \\nBOR Regional Directors who have greater knowledge of local conditions and \\nissues.  One-size-fits-all national policies, especially for non-permanent structures \\nlike boat docks, can create unfavorable and unintentional consequences when \\ntheoretical policy meets local reality.\\n\\nIn an attempt to ease its administrative duties, the BOR has lumped boat docks in \\nwith permanent structures such as cabins and roads under its definition of Private \\nExclusive Uses, resulting in heavy-handed regulation of lesser structures not \\nreplicated by other agencies.  For example, the U.S.Army Corps of Engineers \\ndefines docks as “lesser forms of private use” and grandfathers their existence as \\nlong as they are in “useable and safe condition,” do not present a “threat to life or \\nproperty,” and the holder of the permit is in “substantial compliance with the \\nexisting permit.”\\n\\nPROPOSED RULE CITATIONS –\\n\\n§ 429.2 Definitions.  Private exclusive recreational or residential use means any \\nuse that involves structures or other improvements used for recreational or \\nresidential purposes to the exclusion of public uses or which create the perception \\nof such exclusion and are not associated with the official management of a \\nReclamation project. This includes, but is not limited to, boat docks, cabin sites \\nand associated improvements (including those currently defined in part 21 of this \\ntitle), residences, trailers, manufactured or mobile homes, structures, roads, or \\nother improvements as determined by Reclamation.\\n\\nExcerpted From Army Corps of Engineers SHORELINE MANAGEMENT POLICY \\n1130-2-406.  Shoreline uses that do not interfere with authorized project purposes, \\npublic safety concerns, violate local norms, or result in significant environmental \\naffects should be allowed unless the public participation process identifies \\nproblems in these areas.\\n\\nSUGGESTED REVISION –\\n\\nRedefine boat docks and moorings as lesser forms of private use:\\n\\nLesser forms of private exclusive recreational or residential use mean any use that \\ninvolves boat docks, moorings, piers, launch ramps, fencing, signing, and \\nlandscaping.\\n\\nAllow lesser forms of private use as long as local BOR offices don’t identify \\nproblems.\\n\\nLesser forms of private exclusive recreational or residential use that do not \\ninterfere with authorized project purposes, public safety concerns, violate local \\nnorms, or result in significant environmental affects should be allowed unless the \\nRegional Director identifies problems in these areas through a public participation \\nprocess.\\n\\n\\nRecreational uses of BOR waterways should be governed under regional offices \\nthat are knowledgeable about local conditions and issues.  One-size-fits-all \\npolicies often create unintended negative consequences.\\n\\nDefining boat docks as lesser forms of private use is consistent with other \\nregulatory agencies and eliminates the heavy-handed impact of regulating boat \\ndocks under the same guidelines as permanent structures likes cabins and roads.\\n\\n\\nThank you for your consideration.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoe & Laurie Gabrielsen \\n5401 N Hickory Glen Place\\nBoise, ID 83713\\n\\nTel: 208-375-2405\\nFax: 208-375-2787\\nEmail: rjgabe@qwest.net\\n',\n",

       "  '  Dear Mr. Rizzi:\\nFirst of all, we commend you for many of the changes that were made in the July \\n18, 2008 Proposed Rule.  We believe that many of these changes were the result \\nof comments received by the BOR on the proposed July 18, 2007 rule.  Many of \\nthe clarifications made are essential to a better understanding of the Proposed \\nRule.  However, there is a subpart which remains as a major concern to many of \\nthe cabin site permittees on Nelson Reservoir.  This subpart is as follows:\\n\\n       Subpart H --429.31 (b) Reclamation prohibits any use that would result in new \\nprivate exclusive recreational or residential use of Reclamation land, facilities, or \\nwaterbodies.\\n\\nAt the August 20, 2008 Informational Meeting in Malta, Montana, there was \\nconfusion regarding the interpretation of this subpart.  In one instance it was \\nindicated that \"work\" could be done on existing structures within the \\nexisting \"footprint\" of such structures.  However, if we wanted to enlarge a cabin or \\nstructure, or build something new, that would enlarge the \"footprint\", it would be \\nconsidered \"new\" and thus not allowed.  When many in attendance commented \\nthat such an interpretation would prevent permittees from making improvements, it \\nwas then indicated that our area managers in Billings, Montana would review any \\nsuch requests/applications on a case-by-case basis.\\n\\nThe enlargement and/or addition of a structure, as long as \"within\" the permit area, \\nwould not result in \"new\" private exclusive use or impact public recreational \\nopportunities.  Therefore, further clarification is requested.  We recognize that any \\nsuch \"work\" would have to comply with Rule 11. (a. - k.)  CONSTRUCTION AND \\nMAINTENANCE OF ON-SITE DEVELOPMENTS of our BOR Nelson Reservoir \\npermits.\\n\\nNelson Reservoir is a very important resource in this part of the State and provides \\nsignificant recreational and economic opportunities to permittees, families, friends, \\nand area businesses.  We would strongly urge the BOR to,\\n\\n1.  Allow the continued permitting of existing cabin sites;\\n2.  Increase permit time frames to a minimum of 20 years with renewal options; \\nand\\n3.  Continue to allow permittees to make improvements within their permitted \\nboundaries.\\n\\nThank you for the opportunity to comment.',\n",

       "  'On behalf of Elephant Butte Irrigation District, we would submit the following \\ncomments on the proposed rulemaking for 43 CRF Part 429 Use of Bureau of \\nReclamation Land, Facilities, and Water Bodies appearing in the Federal Register \\non July 18, 2008 and requesting comments by September 16, 2008.\\n\\nElephant Butte Irrigation District (EBID) makes up the New Mexico portion of the \\nRio Grande Project and has numerous contracts with the United States over the \\nrepayment, operation and maintenance of the Rio Grande Project.  As such, it is \\nconsidered a Project beneficiary and actions by the United States in granting use \\nof Reclamation land, facilities and water bodies in the Rio Grande Project have a \\ndirect affect on existing contracts and Reclamation law that governs those \\ncontracts.  EBID is a quasi-municipal state entity and was formed pursuant to \\nNew Mexico law to contract directly with the United States.  The Rio Grande \\nProject (Project) is a single purpose Project and therefore many early reclamation \\nstatutes still apply to the management of this Project that are not applicable to \\nother multi-purpose projects authorized after 1939.\\n\\nForemost on the list is the Act of December 5, 1924 also known as the Fact \\nFinders Act.  In particular, subsection I of this Act requires the Secretary to credit \\nrevenues from project grazing and farm lands to the water users against their \\nrepayment contracts.  These include revenues that arise from the issuance of \\npermits issued under this proposed regulation.  Therefore, irrigation districts \\nacross the country that fall under the Fact Finders Act will be financially affected \\nby this proposed regulation.\\n\\nThe proposed regulations fail to recognize the obligation of the United States to \\naffirmatively seek a reasonable rate of return for Project related land, facilities and \\nwater bodies within the purview of revenue credits under the Fact Finders Act and \\nthe 1926 Omnibus Adjustment Act.  \\n\\nConversely, the regulations instead create a multitude of exceptions to the \\npayment of fees without consideration being given to the Project beneficiaries.  \\nThese exceptions, which produce no revenues, have a direct impact on all affected \\nirrigation districts by increasing their payments to the United States under \\nrepayment, operation and maintenance contracts.  Nowhere in the regulations are \\nthere criteria that examine the detriments to the irrigation districts.\\n\\nSpecific comments by section.\\nIII. Informational Meetings.  The meeting set for the Upper Colorado Region, \\nAlbuquerque, NM date of August 12, conflicted with the monthly board meetings of \\nthe Carlsbad Irrigation District and the Elephant Butte Irrigation District.  These are \\nthe two major Reclamation Projects in New Mexico.  Thus these districts were not \\ngiven the opportunity to question Bureau officials about these regulations.  \\n\\nIV.\\tSummary of Changes.  Comments were previously submitted by EBID \\nwhich raised the issue of financially impacting Pre 1939 single purpose districts by \\nwaiving fees that would normally be credited to repayment or annual O&M \\ncharges.  A partial response was made citing Section 6 of OMB circular A-25 \\nallowing for a reduced fee or waiver under certain circumstances.  However that \\ncircular did not address the issue of how it conflicts with contractual practices and \\nobligations of the Bureau to single purpose projects.\\n    \\nVI. Procedural Requirements.  No response was ever made addressing the issue \\nthat the aforementioned class of irrigation districts financially affected will have an \\neffect of $100M or more on the economy.  It will have that affect just on the \\nirrigation districts themselves.  \\n\\nThis rule alters the budgetary obligations of all affected irrigation districts by \\ndecreasing revenue credits on repayment, operation and maintenance contracts.\\n\\n \\nThis rule clearly raises legal and policy issues with respect to revenue credits.\\n\\nThis rule does constitute a major Federal action because of its impact on existing \\nrepayment, operation and maintenance contracts with irrigation districts.\\n\\nSection 429.23 Administrative costs.  This definition fails to include a reasonable \\ncharge for use of Project related land, facilities and water bodies for the benefit of \\nProject beneficiaries.\\n\\nSection 429.26 recognizes the controversy over approval by water user \\norganizations (which include irrigation districts) but still ignores the financial \\nimpact on these entities by these regulations and does not allow the water user \\norganization an equal voice in granting the request.\\n\\nSection 429.14 fails to include the best interest of affected Project beneficiaries \\nand the impact of not receiving revenue credits creating further financial burden on \\nthe water user organization.\\n\\nSubpart E - Use Fees.  This section fails to include the best interest of affected \\nProject beneficiaries by charging a reasonable fee for the Project beneficiaries and \\nthe impact of not receiving revenue credits.\\n\\nSubpart F - Reductions or Waivers of Application Fees, Administrative Costs, and \\nUse Fees.  \\nSection 429.26 The unilateral decision by Reclamation under this section to waive \\nor reduce fees does not take into consideration the financial impact that the waiver \\nor reduction of the fee will have on water user organizations.\\n\\nSteven L.

The only way the BOR should be involved is to change the name on the \\npermit based on the ownership of the land.  \\nThese rules should include a consistent notification system for expiring permits.  \\nCan you imagine the DMV operating in a manner of non-notification and non-\\nrenewal for drivers licenses or licensing of vehicles.

Prison space is needed for \\ncriminals that are a threat to society, rather than peaceful homeowners that make \\nimprovements to property.\\nFurther, it is completely out of line to have in policy a provision for retroactive \\npenalties without notification of violations such a the trimming of trees.  Again, \\nconversely, the BOR whould be appreciative of the care that homeowners take of \\nBOR property.

As a limited use dock permit holder it \\nseems only fair that prior to termination BOR would have a required notice of such \\ntermination, a legal basis for the termination, as well  the chance to respond to \\nand an opportunity to correct any  transgressions that have led the  BOR to \\nterminate the limited use authorization.\\nDeterminations should  require public comment and involvement from local officials \\nand leaders.  Termination decisions should be based on well defined terms with a \\nperiod to correct problems.\\n\\nThe second comment relates to Subpart H - 429.32 - e.  The concern is with the \\nterms not to exceed 20 years in regards to renewal of authorized existing private \\nexclusive recreational or residential use of Reclamation land.  I see no reason for \\nthe limitation.  The periodic reviews with system for public input is in place in \\nearlier sections\\n\\nMy last comment relates to Subpart H - 429.31 - b.  As written reclamation \\nprohibits any new private residential use of lands.  I feel that in low population \\nareas where there is an extensive mileage of shoreline available for public use \\nthere is no need to prohibit additional limited use dock permits.  The Jamestown \\nReservior has wonderful facilities for public use that are under utilized.  The \\nnumber of bodies of water within 100 miles available for use and more than 20 \\nyears of population decreases, the reasonable expansion of dock permits could \\nassit in maintaining the current population base.   \\n\\nRespectfully submitted,\\nJoan Enderle',\n",

The preamble and rule should be revised to make unambiguous that, \\nwhile the term of renewal of any existing private exclusive recreational or \\nresidential use may not exceed 20 years, the sum of renewals over time could \\nexceed 20 years and has no current maximum duration.  Put another way, the rule \\nshould make clear that a 20-year permit could be renewed for a subsequent 20-\\nyear period again and again.  The preamble should also set out the intent of § \\n429.32(e).\\n\\nb.\\t§ 429.28(a)(3): “Reclamation may, at any time . . . unilaterally \\nterminate the use authorization if Reclamation determines that . . . .”\\n\\nThe rule as written would appear to grant Reclamation the ability to terminate a \\ndock permit for one of the reasons listed in § 429.28(a)(3) without any advance \\nnotice to the permit holder or an opportunity for the permit holder to respond.  The \\ncompliance review under § 429.32(b) appears to apply only to the criteria listed \\nunder § 429.32(a)(1)-(5), and the public comment process under § 429.32(b) \\nappears to apply only to determinations made under § 429.32(a)(2); there does not \\nappear to be any provision in the rule for advance notice to the permit holder or an \\nopportunity for the permit holder to rebut if Reclamation were to terminate under § \\n429.28(a)(3).  The rule should be revised so that Reclamation shall provide a \\npermit holder whose permit is targeted under § 429.28(a)(3) with notice that the \\npermit is being considered for termination, Reclamation’s asserted basis or bases \\nfor the termination, and a meaningful opportunity for the permit holder to be heard \\nto rebut Reclamation’s asserted basis or bases.\\n\\nc.\\t§ 429.28(a)(3)(i) (emphasis added): “Reclamation may, at any time . . . \\nunilaterally terminate the use authorization if Reclamation determines that: (i) . . . \\na higher public use is identified . . . . ”\\n\\nThe rule should identify the factors or procedures that Reclamation shall use to \\ndetermine whether a “higher public use” does or does not exist.  The rule’s \\npreamble should also provide examples of specific public uses that are not “higher” \\nthan specific private exclusive recreational or residential uses.  Without such \\nfactors and examples, the risk is that any proposed public use could be \\ndeemed “higher” than every exisiting private exclusive recreational or residential \\nuse, thus leading to the possible termination under § 429.28(a)(3)(i) of any and \\nevery existing private exclusive recreational or residential use.\\n\\nd.\\t§ 429.28(a)(5) (emphasis added): “Reclamation may, at any time . . . \\nunilaterally terminate any use authorization if the grantee fails to comply with all \\napplicable Federal, State, and local laws, regulations, ordinances, or terms and \\nconditions of any use authorization . . . .”\\n\\nThe rule should define “applicable.”  The rule should also make unambiguous \\nwhether a violation of Federal, State, or local law, regulations, or ordinances wholly \\nunrelated to an individual’s permit could result in the loss of his or her permit or \\nwhether only those violations of law that are materially related to the use \\nauthorization can result in the lose of the permit.\\n\\ne.\\t§ 429.28(b): “The Regional Director may . . . modify these terms and \\nconditions with respect to the contents of the use authorization to meet local and \\nspecial conditions.”\\n\\nPlease provide an example of how this local decision-making might be used at \\nLake Cascade.\\n\\nf.\\t§ 429.32(g): “Renewal decisions of use authorizations for existing \\nprivate exclusive recreational or residential uses located on Reclamation land, \\nfacilities, and waterbodies will be made by the Regional Director.”\\n\\nDoes this mean all Lake Cascade renewal decisions will currently be made by Bill \\nMcDonald?\\n\\ng.             When the dock permit is up for renewal will the Bureau of Reclamation   \\nautomatically send out the required paperwork or will the permit holder be required \\nto monitor permit expiration date and prepare the appropriate paperwork?\\n\\n2.\\tOWNERSHIP TRANSFER – The rule provides no assurance that a \\ndock permit will transfer automatically with the transfer of the adjoining cabin or lot.\\n\\na.\\t§ 429.30: “Your use authorization may not be transferred or assigned to \\nothers without prior written approval of Reclamation . . . .”\\n\\nThe rule requires Reclamation’s prior written approval to transfer a dock permit but \\ngives no assurance that Reclamation will automatically transfer the dock permit in \\nconjunction with the transfer in ownership of the adjoining cabin or lot, nor does it \\ndescribe the criteria under which such transfer would or would not be approved.  \\nWithout an automatic right of transfer, Reclamation could gradually eliminate \\nprivate boat docks by not granting the right of transfer: the subsequent owner of \\nthe lot or cabin would not control the dock and the owner of the dock may not be \\nable to access the dock.  The right to transfer should be automatic, not \\ndiscretionary, by Reclamation.  At a very minimum the regulations should describe \\nthe criteria to be used in determining whether such transfer will be approved or \\ndenied.\\n\\n3.\\tUSE FEES – The rule needs clarification as to the basis for calculating \\nuse fees.\\n\\na.\\t§ 429.23: “The use fee is based on a valuation or by competitive \\nbidding.  Use fees may be adjusted as deemed appropriate by Reclamation to \\nreflect current conditions . . . .”\\n\\nPlease explain how  use fees have been determined for Lake Cascade docks and \\nwhy permit holders have seen double-digit fee escalation over the past 15 years.  \\nThis increase is significantly greater than the previous Reclamation guidelines of a \\nfour percent increase.\\nExample from one permit holder:\\n\\n\\n\\nYear\\t5 – Year Permit Cost\\t   % Change from Prior Permit\\n1993\\t$    657\\t                   400%\\n1998\\t$ 1,012*\\t                    54%*\\n2003\\t$ 1,560\\t                    54%\\n*Estimated at midpoint of 1993 & 2003 fees.\\n\\n\\nStated increases from Reclamation in 1990s were four percent annual increases \\nbeginning with $150 in 1992 and 16% discounts for 5-year payments in full.\\n\\n4.\\tHEAVY-HANDED PENALTIES – Some of the rule’s penalties are \\nunreasonably harsh and appear structured more toward the goal of ultimately \\nterminating permits than to being reasonable sanctions.\\n\\na.\\t§ 429.28(a)(4): “Further, failure to construct or use for any continuous 2-\\nyear period may constitute a presumption of abandonment of the requested use \\nand cause termination of the use authorization.”\\n\\nIf a permit holder’s dock were destroyed by weather, if he or she were financially \\nunable to reconstruct a replacement within two years, and if he or she nonetheless \\npaid his or her dock permit fees, why should he or she lose the right to rebuild \\nwhen his or her personal finances allowed?  The presumption-of-abandonment \\nprovision should be deleted as to existing permits.\\n\\nb.\\t§ 429.33(a): “Unauthorized use . . . may be subject to legal action \\nincluding . . . fine and/or imprisonment for up to 6 months . . . .”\\n\\nPlease identify a scenario where a 6-month jail term would be appropriate for the \\nunauthorized use of a boat dock.\\n\\nIn summary, there appears to be a lot of animosity on the part of the Bureau of \\nReclamation toward the users.

       "  'My wife and I are very concerned about this ruling to eliminate boat docks and \\nrestrict public land access without the voice of the people, especially a mandate \\nfrom BOR officials from outside this state.  We would like to respond to the \\nBureau of Reclamation’s request to comment on the Proposed BOR-2008-004.  I \\nappreciate the efforts the local BOR representatives have made in allowing us to \\nenjoy the open areas around Lake Cascade.  Warren Sedlacek has been very \\ngood to work with.  We have asked his permission before proceeding to do \\nanything on BOR property, including the maintenance of the dock.  He has \\nmarked trees to be thinned and removed for fire prevention or due to disease.  We \\nhave helped him to accomplish this.  With the limited budget, he has appreciated \\nthe local Lake Cascade community for help.  We feel that there has been a \\npartnership developed.  Warren does a great job in separating the private property \\nissues from BOR property.   There may be a few landowners who have abused \\ntheir privileges with the BOR land, but they should be dealt with directly rather \\nthan BOR taking an all-inclusive position with those who have respected the law.  \\nWe have seen a great cooperation between our local BOR representative and the \\nlandowners.  We have enjoyed the privilege of having lake front property and the \\nability to have docks available for fishing and boating.  These docks provide fishing \\nand swimming opportunities to the public as well.   \\nThe landowners have helped prevent erosion and pollution around the lake by using \\nretaining walls made from rocks or other durable materials.  \\nSeveral years ago the landowners fought to keep raw sewage and cattle from the \\nlake.  Because of this we have seen an improvement in water quality and fishing.  \\nThere haven’t been any negative issues with having docks on the lake.  The \\nlandowners have done a nice job in maintaining them.  Without these docks the \\nexisting launch areas would be stressed and overcrowded during the busy times \\nthe public wanted to go boating.  There have been challenges in securing parking \\nwith boat trailers on nice summer days the last several years.  This seems \\ncounter productive in providing recreational areas for the public.  It would actually \\nrestrict the use of Lake Cascade by eliminating access points.  This very thing \\nwould create frustration on the part of the pubic.  Additional parking and boat \\nlaunching areas would cost the public additional dollars. Also, seasonal fees may \\nhave to be increased because of this increased demand.  \\nVacationer dollars would be lost if additional challenges were imposed to use the \\nlake and this could affect the economy in the whole Donnelly-Cascade region.   \\nFrom food and lodging to gas and services.  \\nOver the past several years the Lake Cascade area has seen a steady growth, \\nclean up and revitalization.  People from the city enjoy the mountains, the forests, \\nthe clean air, the snow, and the lakes.  They want more access not less.  There \\nhas been a tremendous growth in this area from people within Idaho and from \\nneighboring states.  With this has come additional tax revenue that is benefiting \\neveryone and also added healthier budgets to governmental \\nagencies.                                                                                                          \\n                         \\nThere needs to be a joint resolution from the people that know this area and the \\nlocal BOR not an agency from Colorado.

The current boat docks add value to Lake Cascade in many \\nways.  We hope that the partnership and respect developed between the Lake \\nCascade Community and the BOR the past several years can continue to grow \\nand flourish.  \\nHopefully, we can work out a plan that would fairly treat all invovled with the issues \\nat hand.

I wish to comment on the proposed \\nrevised changes regarding deficiency cure periods. \\n\\nDock owners notified of deficiencies in their docks currently would have as little as \\n90 days to correct those deficiencies before losing their permits.  Further, no \\nallowance is made for reinstatement of dock permits once revoked, regardless of \\nwhether deficiencies are corrected.\\n\\nPROPOSED RULE CITATIONS –\\n\\n§ 429.32(b) Reclamation will review all existing private exclusive recreational or \\nresidential uses for compliance with the required criteria at least once every 5 \\nyears.  Reclamation will provide the holder of the use authorization with written \\nreport of the results of the compliance review.  The report will state whether the \\nexisting use meets the required criteria listed in this section and will list any \\ndeficiencies that can be corrected.  A minimum of 90 days will be provided to \\nmake corrections identified in the report.  Failure to correct the deficiencies within \\nthe time provided in the report will result in termination of the use authorization.\\n\\nSUGGESTED REVISION –\\n\\nIncrease the minimum number of days provided to make necessary corrections to \\n180 days.\\n\\nIn the event that Reclamation proposes to terminate a use authorization, \\nReclamation will provide a termination report to the grantee which identifies the \\nfacts upon which Reclamation based its determination and Reclamation’s legal \\nbasis for the proposed termination.\\n\\nA minimum of 90 days will be provided to the grantee to rebut the facts, legal \\nbasis, or asserted deficiencies upon which Reclamation based its termination; to \\nintroduce additional facts or a defense; or to propose corrections or additions to \\nthe report.  A grantee will be given 180 days to cure any deficiencies identified and \\nthus avoid nonrenewal or termination.\\n\\n\\nNinety days is too short to repair a dock.  Any dock inadequacies noted in \\nOctober might not be repairable until late spring because the lake is frozen or \\ninaccessible.  Changing the minimum period to make corrections to 180 days \\nwould better recognize the seasonal nature of waterways like Lake Cascade and \\nthe limited pool of available contractors.  Dock owners are willing to repair their \\ndocks; they just need a reasonable amount of time in which to do so.\\n\\nLake docks can now cost upwards of $15,000.  The financial impact of replacing a \\ndock or making costly repairs may be onerous for some when limited to a 90-day \\nwindow.  A 180-day period would better allow for meeting the sometimes \\nsignificant financial obligation of required improvements.\\n\\nThere are many ways a dock owner can lose his or her dock, many of which are \\ntraps for the unwary.  For example, if a family shares a cabin and dock permit and \\nUncle Bob is in charge of the permit fees – and if Uncle Bob drops the ball and \\nfails to pay the permit fee – the whole family loses the dock permit.  A provision \\nshould be added to the rule that if the permit holder or his successor cures the \\nproblem that caused the dock permit to be forfeited within five years of the \\nforfeiture (such as by paying the delinquent bill), the dock permit will be \\nreinstated.  In the alternative, a provision should be added to allow for situations \\nthat merit local BOR office discretion, such a reinstatement of permits lost due to \\nspecial circumstances.\\n',\n",

Box 25007\\nDenver, CO 80225-0007\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProposed Rule \\nComment ID: 1006-AA51\\nDear Mr. Rizzi:\\n\\n\\tWe are writing this letter in response to the Bureau of Reclamation’s \\nrequest for comments specific to the Proposed Rule 1006-AA51 titled Use of \\nBureau of Reclamation Land, Facilities, and Waterbodies. Specifically, we would \\nlike to address the proposed changes to Subpart H – Prohibited and Unauthorized \\nUses of Reclamation Land, Facilities, and Waterbodies, which proposes to \\neliminate docks owned and maintained by private individuals through non-renewal \\nof existing use authorizations.\\n\\n\\tThe opening paragraph of Section §429.31, while specifically \\naddressing new structures, articulates an overall desire to prohibit “private \\nexclusive recreation or residential use of Reclamation land, facilities, or \\nwaterbodies, or the perception thereof.”  Section §429.32 expands the desired \\nprohibition to existing docks, stating, “When authorizations for these uses expire, \\nReclamation generally will not renew them.”\\n\\n\\tAs landowners on Idaho’s Lake Cascade, we vigorously oppose this \\nproposal for the following reasons:\\n\\t\\t1. Elimination of docks and buoys in front of private \\nresidences will decrease accessibility\\nto the reservoir and shoreline by the general public, not increase it. Public access \\npoints currently coexist harmoniously with private residences. However, removal of \\nhomeowner docks will force residents onto public docks, reducing the availability \\nof mooring sites for visitors.\\n\\t\\t2. Replacement of even half of the approximately 300 \\nexisting docks on Lake Cascade with docks paid for and maintained by the \\nBureau would be cost prohibitive, thus ensuring a substantial and unacceptable \\nreduction in the number of available docks and deepwater moorings. Federal funds \\nwill clearly be insufficient to replace the vast majority of existing docks and \\nmoorings with public structures, creating a major inconvenience for all who seek \\nto use the lake. In addition, with the average cost of private docks running $10,000 \\nto $12,000, and the average lifespan well under 10 years, ongoing maintenance \\nand replacement costs will likely become an unacceptable taxpayer burden, again \\nassuring continued degradation of available mooring sites for all lake users.\\n\\t\\t3. Seeking replacement of private docks with expensive \\ncommunity docks paid for by homeowner associations is not likely to be \\nsuccessful. Privately funded community docks are highly unlikely to be endorsed \\nby homeowners who are struggling under the weight of triple-digit tax increases \\nand the sour taste of government mandated scrapping of the significant investment \\nthey have already made in their existing docks.\\n\\t\\t4. Loss of the vast majority of deepwater moorings, as well \\nas docks, on Lake Cascade will significantly increase the risk to personal safety \\nfor all lake users as well as damage to boats. Shallow reservoirs like Lake \\nCascade suffer frequent periods of major wave activity caused by sudden wind \\nsurges sweeping unannounced over the surrounding mountains. Waves 3-4 feet in \\nheight make dock and shore moorings ill advised, and their quick onset leave little \\ntime to get boats several miles to the nearest public extraction point. Assisting \\nboaters in trouble will be significantly diminished if our boats are moored a mile \\naway.\\n\\t\\n\\tElimination of docks in front of private residences will result in (a) \\npeople placing themselves at risk trying to get boats quickly to a limited number \\nof public docks, and (b) then waiting in line watching helplessly as boaters \\nstruggle against the ever-increasing winds to remove their craft from danger. It has \\nhappened to us before we had a dock and resulted in chaos as people on shore \\ntried to help steer our larger boat onto our trailer putting them at great risk of being \\nhurt. As it was, our boat was damaged when the wind pushed it into one of the \\nsteel piling.\\t\\n\\t\\n\\tWe private homeowners are the very individuals who are a waterway’s \\nmost ardent defenders. We are the ones who advocate for protection of water \\nquality. We work at our own expense to stabilize the lake’s banks and mitigate \\nerosion. We make sure that beaches are clean of trash and debris. We encourage \\ncourtesy and respect by and for all users. We pay the property taxes that help \\nsupport needed local services like police, fire, and water safety.\\n\\n\\tWhile we understand and support the Bureau of Reclamation’s \\ncommitment to make its waterways available to all people, we believe current \\nregulations accomplish that goal. Elimination of the vast majority of available dock \\nand mooring sites through this proposed rule, however, will create fewer amenities \\nfor all waterway users, substantially raise federal capital and annual maintenance \\ncosts, and significantly increase the safety risk to families and their watercraft. \\n\\nFor the sake of the smaller landowners, we urge you to consider our requests and \\ncontinue the existing public/private partnership you have created on Bureau of \\nReclamation waterways.

Transfer of the dock\\npermit should be automatic with the sale of the property and/or  inheritance of\\nsame.\\nMy other comment is that the rules,permits, and fee should not be assigned\\nwithout public comment.  I do not feel the BOR should have unilateral authority\\nto do whatever it wishes without public input by those parties\\naffected--something that I think goes back to the writing of  the Constitution\\nof The United States of America--there shall not be taxation without\\nrepresentation.

This is the major concern of mine, as a person who purchased my \\nproperty under federal law specifically addressing Canyon Ferry Lake. Under the \\nlaw, I have been given several property rights, such as private (exclusive) access \\nto the lake from my property, the right to one private dock, and the ability to \\nimprove shoreline features to protect against erosion and/or access the shoreline \\nand dock. I believe that the rules as currently proposed might invite interpretations \\nthat would be contrary to provisions of the Canyon Ferry Lake Act.\\n\\nTherefore, my most serious concern is that rule language should explicitly \\nrecognize the special circumstance of this private ownership and property rights, \\nand that no language in the proposed, then adopted, rule can be interpreted to \\nabrogate these rights. Specifically, no part of the rule should keep landowners, \\nunder the Canyon Ferry Lake Act from rightful access to shoreline, from exercising \\ndock privileges and from erecting structures as provided under the law and \\nrecognized under the recently proposed Canyon Ferry Shoreline Management \\nPlan. Please insert clear language to assure protection of our property owner’s \\nrights under the Canyon Ferry Lake Act.\\n\\nImportantly, please make sure that language around “exclusive use” concept \\nassures that the there is nothing that limits the continuation of the property rights \\nof the original owners and their successors and assigns. No language anywhere in \\nthe proposed rule should implicitly, explicitly, or by interpretation prevent the legal \\ntransfer of all permitted improvements from present owners to their successors \\nand assigns.\\n\\nRelated to the section of the rule pertaining to continuation of existing private \\nexclusive use, language in 43 CFR 429 should not encourage review, review \\ncriteria, decision-making , and/or fee structures that would effectively limit my \\nrights to access my property and/or adjacent shoreline and docks.\\n\\nWe appreciate your considering this written testimony and comment on the \\nproposed July 18, 2008 Part II 43 CRF 429.\\n',\n",

Reference: Subpart H - 429.31 (b) Reclamation prohibits any use that wouldresult in \"new\" private exclusive recreational or residential use of Reclamation land, facilities, orwaterbod ies.At the meeting, we were told the interpretation of this rule was that work within the existing \"footprint\" ofthe existing buildings on the site was allowed. But, if we wanted to expand the \"footprint\" by enlargingthe existing cabin or add a storage shed, this would be considered \"new\" private exclusive use andwould not be allowed.When further interpretation was asked; the response was directed to our areamanagers in Billings; who indicated they would review the applications on a case by case basis.Itwould be helpful for those of us who have existing permit and who might want to improve our cabinsor request an additional shed on the site; have the BOR clearly define their interpretation between\"new\" and \"existing\" uses in the Federal Register.By adding additional structures or enlarging ones existing on an already in-use site would not result in\"new\" private exclusive use of BOR land. Most sites on Nelson Reservoir are on approx .10 of an acreand enlarging or adding additional structures would have absolutely no impact to public recreationalopportunities at Nelson Reservoir.Iwould like to request, the proposed wording in the next Federal Register Subpart H 429.31 (b) read:\"Reclamation prohibits any use that would result in new private exclusive recreational orresidential useoutside the already existingpermittedareasof Reclamation land, facilities, orwaterbodies.\"Page 1 of 2Laura WoodwardP0 Box 1382Malta MT 59538-1382With this slight re-wording of the Federal Register the existing cabin-site permit holders will be providedthe opportunity to improve or enlarge their cabins or maybe put up a small shed by following theguidelines in our existing permit.

We have been paying anannual fee for a least 7 years to maintain a permit to build a dock on Bureau of Reclamation propertyadjoining our property at 227 Lee Way, Donnelly, Idaho. Thus far we have expended in excess of$2000 for the permit although we haven\\'t had the money to build on our property or to build thepermitted dock. If the Section 429.28(a)(4) is enacted we will lose our permit even though we havebeen paying all this time trusting that the Bureau of Reclamation was acting in good faith.Therefore, the second sentence of 429.28(a)(4) which reads: \"Further, failure to construct or use for anycontinuous 2-year period may constitute a presumption of abandonment of the requested use and causetermination of the use authorization\" should be DELETED from the revised proposed rule. Propertyowners who have a permit, but have not yet built a dock, could have a variety of reasons for waiting.Perhaps the owners are elderly and want the dock for when their children take over their home.Perhaps, like us, they haven\\'t built homes yet so haven\\'t been able to use a dock but want that option inthe future and are willing to pay now to keep that option open. The reason should not matter. In the pastthe BOR decided, through the act of granting the permit in the first place, that a dock was acceptable atthat location which is all that should matter. This is like changing the rules of the game in the middle ofthe play the only benefit of which is to reduce the number of private boat docks on Cascade Reservoir.Certainly BOR doesn\\'t gain from the loss of revenues if current permitees quit paying and this servesno good purpose for the public either.Sincerely,Robert and Marilyn Tratz2841 Lancaster Dr.Boise, ID 83702CC: Senator Mike Crapo, Senator Larry Craig, Representative Mike Simpson, Representative Bill Sali,Dirk Kempthorne, Governor Butch Otter, Lee Heinrich, Ken Roberts, J.

In the Proposed Rule Revising 43 CFR part 429 of the Federal Register, section28(5)there needsto be provision for people to challenge the BOR rather than having action being taken \"unilaterally\"and \"at no cost or liability to the United States.\" People need a voice in what is happening to them andpublic review is needed. The term \"higher public use\" in 429.28(I) and \"greater public needs\" in429.32 can both be used \"unilaterally\" to the detriment of an individual or family. There needs to besome recourse for the individual unless the real goal of the BOR is to totally eliminate private docksfrom the reservoir.Sincerely,Robert and Marilyn Tratz2841 Lancaster Dr.Boise, ID 83702CC: Senator Mike Crapo, Senator Larry Craig, Representative Mike Simpson, Representative Bill Sali,Dirk Kempthome, Governor Butch Otter, Lee Heinrich, Ken Roberts, J.

Any newdocks would have to be confined to that limited shoreline with the rest being devoted to public usage.If property owners are limited to public boat dock mooring space recreational opportunities for thepublic are actually more reduced. Boat docks in 429.32 (b) {I} {ii}need to be defined as \"LesserForms of Private Use\" and regulated by an individual lake\\'s \"Resource Management Plan\".Sincerely,.Robert and Marilyn Tratz2841 Lancaster Dr.Boise, ID 83702CC: Senator Mike Crapo, Senator Larry Craig, Representative Mike Simpson, Representative Bill Sali,Dirk Kempthorne, Governor Butch Otter, Lee Heinrich, Ken Roberts, J William McDonald, andJerrold GreggSeptember 4, 2008Mr. Richard RizziBureau of ReclamationDenver Federal CenterP0 Box 25007Denver, CO 80225-0007Regarding 1 006-AAS 1, Docket BOR-2008-0004Dear Mr. Rizzi,It appears that 429.32 (h) makes obtaining permit renewals solely the responsibility of permit holders.Because there is such an enormous penalty for missing a renewal date - permanent loss of one\\'s boatdock - permit holders need to be notified by BOR in writing 90 days prior to permit expiration dates.There could be many reasons for a family being unaware of a renewal date or preoccupied with urgentmatters thereby missing that all important date. BOR offices issuing permits need to have discretionaryauthority to reinstate lapsed permits when holders can show lack of notice or other extenuatingcircumstances.Sincerely,Robert and Marilyn Tratz2841 Lancaster Dr.Boise, ID 83702CC: Senator Mike Crapo, Senator Larry Craig, Representative Mike Simpson, Representative Bill Sali,Dirk Kempthome, Governor Butch Otter, Lee Heinrich, Ken Roberts, J William McDonald, andJerrold GreggSeptember 4, 2008Mr. Richard RizziBureau of ReclamationDenver Federal CenterP0 Box25007Denver, CO 80225-0007Regarding 1006-AA5 1, Docket BOR-2008-0004Dear Mr. Rizzi,429.32 (b) needs to be rewritten to extend the minimum period to make corrections to a problem with adock to 270 days from the 90 stated in the new rule which would better recognize the seasonal natureof dock usage at Lake Cascade and the limited number of qualified contractors available. Lake dockscan cost $15,000 so the financial impact of replacing or repairing a dock can be substantial and apermit holder may well need the longer time to manage that. A provision should be added to the rulethat if the permit holder or his successor cures the problem that caused the dock permit to be forfeitedwithin five years of the forfeiture (such as paying the delinquent bill), the dock permit will bereinstated.Sincerely,Robert and Marilyn Tratz2841 Lancaster Dr.Boise, ID 83702CC: Senator Mike Crapo, Senator Larry Craig, Representative Mike Simpson, Representative Bill Sali,Dirk Kempthorne, Governor Butch Otter, Lee Heinrich, Ken Roberts, J William McDonald, andJerrold GreggSeptember 4, 2008Mr. Richard RizziBureau of ReclamationDenver Federal CenterP0 Box25007Denver, CO 80225-0007Regarding 1006-AAS 1, Docket BOR-2008-0004Dear Mr. Rizzi,Regarding 43 CFR Part 429.30 we believe the proposed rule doesn\\'t recognize homeowners\\' rights totransfer their dock permits to their heir or to new owners when they sell their property. As written theright to transfer the permit is solely regulated by the local BOR office.Assuming that the permit holder has complied with existing permit requirements, the homeowners\\'right to transfer the dock permit when property ownership changes should be recognized in this ruleand BOR\\'s sole authority over such transfers should be limited to record-keeping and permitcompliance.Sincerely,Robert and Marilyn Tratz2841 Lancaster Dr.Boise, ID 83702CC: Senator Mike Crapo, Senator Larry Craig, Representative Mike Simpson, Representative Bill Sali,Dirk Kempthorne, Governor Butch Otter, Lee Heinrich, Ken Roberts, J.

Box 25007Denver, CO 80225-0007Attn: Richard Rizzi, Mail Code: 84-53000To Whom It May Concern:Iam writing to comment on item\"1006-AA5I\"My name is Kevin Jones and myself, my wife, and kids (ages 4 and 7) own a home on LakeCascade in Donnelly, Idaho. I have worked very hard over my life to be able to afford my homeand after looking at numerous locations around the country I decided on Lake Cascade as theperfect place to build my dream home. The main item I was looking at with regard to the perfectplace to raise my family would be a home with water-frontage and a dock. Growing up I alwaysdreamed of a home with a dock to be able to spend quality time with my family. I\\'ve nowinvested every penny I have into my dream home only to find that there is the possibility oflosing my dock over time from the new proposed law. Sure, it may not be in the next year ortwo but I know how laws are written to appease the folks who are complaining. There is usuallyverbiage written to pacify the complainers in the interim until a few years pass by and then thenext administration is faced with enforcing the changed law. In the case of Lake Cascade itappears the BOR is trying to make a \"one size fits all\" law without taking into consideration theindividual lakes and their specific circumstances. A good example of this deals with \"perceivedprivate exclusive use\". In the case of Lake Cascade, just 10% of the 86-mile shoreline is zonedfor private residential usage. How could so few docks create \"perceived private exclusive use\"when 90% of the shoreline is available and accessible publicly?In reading the proposed revisions I noted that in section 429.32(h) it states that the BOR doesNOT need to notify dock-holders that a renewal date is pending or past due. The penalty formissing the renewal is the LOSS OF YOUR DOCK!! This is ridiculous at the very least. At aminimum the BOR should be required to notify the owners in writing at least 90-days prior to thepermit expiration date. In the case where a change of address or other extenuatingcircumstance caused the permit owner to miss their payment by the expiration date there shouldbe remedy on the part of the permit holder other than LOSING THEIR DOCK!I implore you to make sure that no Lake Cascade dock-holders lose their docks or that you don\\'tdraft legislation that will lead to that several years from now. Please, do the right thing andmake sure our families get a life-time of fun on the docks we rightly deserve!Respecfully,Kevin JonesP0 Box 1015Donnelly, ID 83615',\n",

The report will state whether the existinguse meets the required criteria listed in this section and will list any deficiencies that canbe corrected.A minimum of 90 days will be provided to make corrections identified inthe report. A failure to correct the deficiencies within the time provided in the report willresult in termination of the use authorization.Dear Mr. Rizzi;This part of the rule makes sense from the view that permit holders should be held to atleast a minimum standard of maintenance and repairs, and the BOR needs to be able tohold these permit holders responsible.The part of this rule that will cause undue hardships to permit holders is the 90 day cureperiod needs to be longer in order to fairly allow the necessary repairs to be made.Thereare many factors beyond the control of the permit holder, for example the time of yearmay make those repairs impossible, or a permit may be required if it involves problemson the shoreline. A 9 month or 1 year cure period would certainly be more fair andmanageable to all concerned.In the event a permit holder lost their permit due to the 90 day rule the rule as it iscurrently being proposed would prohibit a new permit being issued.We need to be ableto have new private exclusive recreational uses when it makes sense.Thank you,Steve Fredriksen896 E.

I find thechange proposing that there be no more dock permits issued, to be discriminatory topresent landowners. This is especially so, since you have now said (with ambiguity) thatpresent permit holders may continue to do so.Lake Cascade is a public resource used for private irrigation and semi-private powergeneration.How can you justify taking away the privilege of so-called \"private\" docksThese docks are not private usage of BOR land.They are merely an indication that theproperty owners have paid for a permit.

Thegovernment\\'s interest would be served withy longer renewal terms or the privatization ofthe residential use areas. 429.32 [e}.The criteria for renewal of existing private exclusive recreational and residential usesare too vague.The terms \"project operations\" and \"authorized project purposes\" are notdefined.

It has been an important part of keeping the family together fromgeneration to generation. Considering this family use, the cabin was recently rebuilt.The proposed rule will adversely impact continuation of this practice.I attended the informational meeting held August 20, 2008 at Malta, Montana. Iappreciate the presentations and questions/answer process at that meeting. However, Ihave the following comments:A. For rural and less populated areas such as northeastern Montana, the proposedrule runs counter to the stated purpose of promoting public use and high qualityrecreational opportunities and represents management practices that are not in the bestinterests of the government.The past practice of granting - and then regularly extending - private exclusiveresidential use authorizations encouraged public investment by local residents. Localresidents tend to have a greater stake in becoming and do become responsible users andcaretakers. Responsible users and caretakers are required to develop and maintain highquality recreational opportunities.The proposed rule, with its provisions prohibiting new improvements and subjectingexisting improvements to vague criteria, will eliminate this local user encouragementand, in turn, reduce the chances for developing a high quality recreational location. TheU.S. Government\\'s interest is better served with long-term renewal or privatization ofresidential use areas.McKeon 9/07/08 comment - Proposed Rule 43 CFR part 429B.The proposed rule allows for existing private exclusive recreational andresidential uses to remain provided certain criteria are met. The listed criteria include (1)compatibility with authorized project purposes, project operations, safety and security;(2) compatibility with public needs; (3) environmental compliance; (4) public health andsafety; and(5)current in financial obligation. 429.32(a). Critical parts of this criteria arevague.The term \"compatibility\" implies that a use is capable of existing together in harmonywith other uses. What are the factors for determining this \"compatibility\"? The proposedrule should require consideration of all relevant factors, including but not limited toduration of use, type of use and willingness of user to make appropriate adjustment.The terms, \"authorized project purposes\" and \"project operations,\" are not defined.Who is the \"authorizing\" body or agency? How are \"project purposes\" defined? Whatconstitutes \"project operations\"?What are the applicable standards for \"safety\" or\"security\" in criteria (1)?What is the distinction between \"safety\" in criteria (1) and\"public safety\" in criteria (4)?The definition of \"public needs\" in criteria (2) includes the vague terms \"recreationalrequirements of the general public\" and \"areas where existing ... use authorizations arepresent.\" Just what are the \"recreational requirements of the general public?\"Whatdefines the \"areas\" where these requirements would exist? 429.2C.The definition of the term, \"private exclusive recreational or residential use,\" istoo broad. The proposed rule would require use authorizations to annually launch amovable/floating dock or to use roads to enter cabin sites. At the informational meeting,BOR personnel indicated that movable/floating docks would not be restricted but theproposed rule gives no such assurance. 429.2D.The proposed rule calls for no \"new private exclusive recreational or residentialuse.\" This term could include remodel, tear down and rebuild, and expansion. Again, atthe informational meeting, BOR personnel indicated that improvements within the samefootprint will not be considered a \"new\" use but the proposed rule gives no suchassurance. 429.31E.The proposed rule calls for termination of a use authorization if corrective actionis not done in a minimum of 90 days. Further, upon nonrenewal or termination, thegrantee must remove improvements within 90 days. Given the shorter constructionseason of northern states, this 90 day period will not always be adequate. The proposedrule needs to give users assurance this time period can be extended for good cause.429.32(b)(d)(f)F.The proposed rule calls for the \"Regional Director\" to make determinations,including renewal decisions and those based on \"fair and efficient administration\" of therule.At the informational meeting, BOR personnel indicated that these decisions wouldMcKeon 9/07/08 comment - Proposed Rule 43 CFR part 4292be made at the state level but there is no such assurance in the proposed rule. Rather,\"Regional Director\" can be construed to allow a Regional Director from any of5regionsto make those decisions. 429.32(c)(g), 429.34, 429.2G.The proposed rule allows for 20 year maximum renewal of use authorizations,subject to periodic review at least once every5years.The 20 year time period is notadequate. The public use and the quality of that use is better promoted by a longer periodor, at the least, the continuation of existing permit practice that grants users the option torenew. 429.32(e)H.The proposed rule provides BOR may unilaterally terminate a use authorizationfor failure to use and a presumption of abandonment exist on failure to construct or useforany continuous 2-year period. To avoid this presumption, the proposed rule needs tooutline a procedure for construction/use documentation. 429.28(4)I.The proposed rule calls for BOR decisions to be sent to the applicant/user bymail. BOR may not always have the right user address. The mere deposit in the mail isnot adequate.This provision should require certified mail, return receipt requested.429.34(a). Likewise, the 30 day appeal period should commence on date of receipt,rather than date of the determination letter. 429.35.Thank you for the opportunity to respond.ssional DelegationMcKeon 9/07/08 comment - Proposed Rule 43 CFR part 429',\n",

Thus, a homeowner couldlose his or her boat dock permitpermanentlyas soon as this rule becomes effective if the permit wasgranted more than 2 years ago and no dock exists on the effective date of the rule.5.Revoking a valid permit because a dock has not yet been built denies homeowners of a future right theyhave long paid for and is just one more example of the BOR attempting to remove docks from areas likeLake Cascade one permit at a time.6.Whywould the BOR reduce its existing revenue stream by revoking valid permits other than toremove docks from areas like Lake Cascadeone permit at a time?7.Leaving enforcement of this section to the discretion of local BOR officials is unacceptable sinceexisting personnel will someday retire or move on, leaving future decision making to unknown individualswith unknown intentions.

Box 25007Denver, CO 80225-0007Dear Mr. Rizzi:ISSUE STA TEMENT -Boat docks should be defined asLesser Forms of Private Useand regulated under BOR RegionalDirectors who have greater knowledge of local conditions and issues. One-size-fits-all national policies,especially for non-permanent structures like boat docks, can create unfavorable and unintentionalconsequences when theoretical policy meets local reality.In its attempt to ease its administrative duties, the BOR has lumped boat docks in with permanentstructures such as cabins and roads under its definition ofPrivate Exclusive Uses,resulting in heavyhandedregulation of lesser structures not replicated by other agencies. For example, the Army Corps of Engineersdefines docks as\"lesser forms ofprivate use\"and grandfather\\'s their existence as long as they are in\"useable and safe condition,\"do not present a\"threat to life or properly,\"and the holder of the permit is in\"substantial compliance with the existing permit.\"PROPOSED RULE CITATiONS-§ 429.2 Definitions.Private exclusive recreational or residential useneans any use that involvesstructures or other improvements usedfor recreational or residential purposes to the exclusion of publicuses or which create the perception of such exclusion and are not associated with the official managementof a Reclamation project.

One-size-fits-all policies often create unintended negative consequences.2.Defining boat docks asLesser Forms of Private Useis consistent with other regulatoryagencies and eliminates the heavy-handed impact of regulating boat docks under the same guidelines aspermanent structures likes cabins and roads.Sincerely,J(WCColton & Tyra Schoite\"I 76 Boulder PlaceDonnelly, Idaho83615Proposed Rule Comment ID: 1006-AASILocal Control for Lesser Forms of Private UseRichard RizziMail Code: 84-53000Bureau of ReclamationDenver Federal CenterP.O.

Box25007Denver, CO 80225-0007Dear Mr. Rizzi:ISSUE STA TEMENTThe term forcompliance reviews [429.32 (b)J,especially when applied to docks,isunnecessarily brief and should be expanded from5to 20 years. In addition, compliancelanguage should be clarified to direct that compliance reviews for docks be done on a lakewidebasis since individual dock compliance will occur at permit renewal.The term forpermit renewals [429.32 (e)], is confusing and requires clarification. As stated,it appears to limit dock permit renewals to a 20-year horizon. BOR officials have stated theirintention is to limit individual permit periods to a maximum of 20 years but allow for renewalswithout limit. Rule language should clearly reflect that intent.PROPOSED RULE CITATIONS-§429.32 (b)Reclamation will review all existing private exclusive recreational or residentialuses for compliance with the required criteria at least once every 5 years.§429.32 (e)Any renewal of use authorizations for existing private exclusive recreational orresidential uses of Reclamation land, facilities, and waterbodies will not exceed 20 year terms.Any such renewals will be subject to the periodic review described in subsection (b) [above],and these reviews could potentially result in the termination of the use agreement prior to theend of the term ofyears.DISCUSSION POINTS -1.Mandating BOR offices to conduct compliance reviews for docks every5years:places an unnecessary financial and administrative burden on regional offices, andencourages rubber stamping of previous reviews.2.Expanding the compliance review period toat least once every 20 years:reflects a more reasonable time period in which lake-wide situations may change,allows for more frequent reviews if circumstances warrant, andencourages more thorough reviews when they do occur.3.Conducting compliance reviews on a lake-wide basis appropriately focuses attention onoverall lake conditions and the impact of all docks.

However, the local BORoffice has yet to issue use authorizations for landscaping in accordance with Lake Cascade\\'sResource Management Plan (RMP). Therefore, existing landscaping or retaining walls thatshould have been issued use authorizations in the past and grandfathered now would beconsidered as new use requests and thus prohibited and subject to civil and criminal penalties.PROPOSED RULE CITATIONS-§429.3 (b)Reclamation prohibits any use that would result in new private exclusive recreationalor residential use of Reclamation land, facilities, or waterbodies.(1) Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:(i)Cabins, mobile homes, residences, outbuildings, and related structures, and associatedlandscaping, patios, decks, and porches.DISCUSSION POINTS -1.New lesser forms of private uses such as landscaping and shoreline stabilization wallsimprove the appearance, forest health, erosion control and continuity between water bodiesand adjacent private lands when the following conditions are met:Distance between private land and high water line is generally less than150 ft.Landscaping does not impede lateral pedestrian traffic along shoreline.Landscaping provides continuity between the shoreline in residential areas.2.Homeowner efforts to improve the Lake Cascade shoreline, in accordance with the Lake\\'sexisting Resource Management Plan, should be encouraged.The top recreational activity on Lake Cascade is renting a pontoon boat fromTamarack to view cabins on the Lake. Maintaining an appealing shoreline isimportant to homeowners and recreational visitors.Any appearance of private use is created by existing cabins, not landscaping.The overly dense timber in these areas can become infested with beetles and blisterrust. Thinning can help prevent further damage.Unabated shoreline erosion denigrates water quality and decreases lake depth.Maintaining narrow strips of wilderness between the lake and residences is anineffective approach to preserving natural habitat.Sincerely,Colton & Tyra Scholtec176 Boulder PlaceDonnelly, Idaho 83615Proposed Rule Comment ID: 1006-AA5ILandscapingRichard RizziMail Code: 84-53000Bureau of ReclamationDenver Federal CenterP.O. Box25007Denver, CO 80225-0007Dear Mr. Rizzi:ISSUE STA TEMENT -As written, the proposed rule places no requirement on the BOR to inform permit holders of expiringpermits. Lack of such notice, combined with the rule\\'s clear prohibition against reinstatement of lapsedpermits, results in permanent loss of docks for unaware homeowners who miss renewal deadlines.Rule language should be modified to require permit issuing BOR offices to mail notice of expiring permitsto addresses of record at least 90 days prior to such expirations.PROPOSED RULE CITATIONS-§429.32 (h)Requests for renewal, transfer, extension, or reissuance of use authorizations/or privateexclusive recreational or residential uses authorizations for private exclusiverecreational or residential uses that expired prior to the effective date of this part or aresubsequently not renewed or terminated under the procedures of this section will be considered requestsJbr uses prohibited under §429.31 and will not be approved.

Given the enormous penalty for missing a renewal date - permanent loss of one\\'sdock - lack of any notice requirement on the part of BOR appears to be one more blatant attempt toremove lake docks one by one.2.By rule, BOR offices issuing permits should be required to notif\\' permit holders in writing to theiraddress of record at least 90 days prior to permit expiration dates.3.BOR offices issuing permits should be given discretionary authority to reinstate lapsed permitswhere holders can show lack of notice or other extenuating circumstances.Sincerely.Colton & Tyra Scholtec176 Boulder PlaceDonnelly, Idaho 83615Proposed Rule Comment ID: 1006-AA51Renewal NoticeRichard RizziMail Code: 84-53000Bureau of ReclamationDenver Federal CenterP.O. Box 25007Denver, CO 80225-0007Dear Mr. Rizzi:ISSUE STA TEMENT -Dock owners notified of deficiencies in their docks currently would have as little as 90 days tocorrect those deficiencies before losing their permits. Further, no allowance is made forreinstatement of dock permits once revoked, regardless of whether deficiencies are corrected.PROPOSED RULE CITATIONS -§429.32 (b)Reclamation will review all existing private exclusive recreational or residentialuses for compliance with the required criteria at least once evety 5 years. Reclamation willprovide the holder of the use authorization with written report of the results of the compliancereview. The report will state whether the existing use meets the required criteria listed in thissection and will list any deficiencies that can be corrected. A niniinum of9O days will beprovided to make corrections identUled in the report. Failure to correct the deficiencies withinthe time provided in the report will result in termination of the use authorization.DISCUSSION POiNTS -1.Ninety days is too short to repair a dock. Any dock inadequacies noted in October mightnot be repairable until late spring because the lake is frozen or inaccessible. Changingthe minimum period to make corrections to 270 days would better recognize the seasonalnature of waterways like Lake Cascade and the limited pool of available contractors.Dock owners are willing to repair their docks; they just need a reasonable amount of timeinwhich to do so.2.Lake docks can now cost upwards of$ 15,000. The financial impact of replacing a dockor making costly repairs may be onerous for some when limited to a 90-day window. A270-day period would better allow for meeting the sometimes significant financialobligation of required improvements.3.There are many ways a dock owner can lose his or her dock, many of which are traps forthe unwary. For example, if a family shares a cabin and dock permit and Uncle Bob is incharge of the permit fees - and if Uncle Bob drops the ball and fails to pay the permit fee-the whole family loses the dock permit. A provision should be added to the rule that ifthe permit holder or his successor cures the problem that caused the dock permit to beforfeited within five years of the forfeiture (such as by paying the delinquent bill), thedock permit will be reinstated. In the alternative, a provision should be added to allowfor situations that merit local BOR office discretion, such a reinstatement of permits lostdue to special circumstances.Sincerely,Colton & Tyra ScholtecU176 Boulder PlaceDonnelly, Idaho83615Proposed Rule Comment ID: 1006-AASIDeficiency Cure Period',\n",

However your current revision allows to many ways to revoke a permit.Since its determined that these docks are an asset to the lake, dock owners should havecontinued dock permits, priced fairly and to be able to pass onto heirs or transfer with theproperty if sold. The only real reason to revoke a permit is if the dock is so torn up as to bea danger to the public. Even then the owners should be notified and given ample time toclear out the dock and replace it with a new one. As mentioned these docks are an assetto the lake.When boats and forced to pull up on sand, mud, rocks, etc. there are hazardsto people and machinery, not to mention additonal soil erosion on the banks of the lake.This is a common sense issue to retain individual boat docks at Lake Cascade.I appreciate the opportunity to respond to this ruling.Richard PaulsonAileen Paulson',\n",

       "  'Comments on RIN 1006ŒAA51 9 September 2008 \\nThe proposed rule requires authorizations for commercial filming and commercial \\nphotography on Reclamation land, but does not define either activity. I write to propose \\ntwo possible ways of clarifying the mean\\ning of commercial photography; I have no \\nexperience with filming, and accordingly make\\n no comment other than to note that the National Park Service apparently recognized that they had erred in treating small \\ndocumentary filmmakers the same as large-scale motion picture companies. \\nIn May 2000, Congress placed statutory limitations on the conditions under which \\npermits can be required for st\\nill photography. Those limitations were given in Public Law \\n106-206, codified at 16 USC 460l-6d, and which reads, in relevant part, SECTION 1. COMMERCIAL FILMING. \\n(a) COMMERCIAL FILMING FEE.ŠThe Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \\nAgriculture (hereafter individually referred to \\nas the ﬁSecretaryﬂ with respect to lands under \\ntheir respective jurisdiction) shall require a \\npermit and shall establish a reasonable fee for \\ncommercial filming activities or similar proj\\nects on Federal lands administered by the \\nSecretary. . . . \\n(c) STILL PHOTOGRAPHY.Š(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary shall \\nnot require a permit nor assess a fee for still photography on lands administered by the \\n\\nSecretary if such photography takes place where members of the public are generally \\n\\nallowed. The Secretary may require a permit, fee, or both, if such photography takes place at \\n\\nother locations where members of the public ar\\ne generally not allowed, or where additional \\nadministrative costs are likely. \\n(2) The Secretary shall require and shall estab\\nlish a reasonable fee for still photography that \\nuses models or props which are not a part of the site™s natural or cultural resources or \\nadministrative facilities. \\nReclamation land is under the \\njurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior, so the \\nrequirements of Pub. L. 106-206 would appear\\n to govern commercial filming and still \\nphotography. Consequently, the meaning of \\nﬁcommercial photographyﬂ should be limited \\nto conditions for which a permit can be required under Pub. L. 106-206. This could be \\ndone in at least two different ways. Defining Commercial Photography The rule could define commercial photography; the definition could be made from a \\n\\nsimple rearrangement of the wording of \\nPub. L. 106-206, reading to the effect of Commercial photography means the recording on film, el\\nectronic, or other media of a \\nstill image that uses models, props, or sets \\nthat are not a part of the location™s natural or cultural resources or administrative facilities. \\nTo ensure uniform interpretations of the rule, \\nmodel and prop should also be defined. The intent of the still photography provisions in Pub. L. 106-206 was to incorporate the policy   Jeff Conrad  9 September 2008 \\nComments on RIN 1006ŒAA51  \\nPage 2 of the National Park Service, which was governed by 36 CFR 5.5(b);1 accordingly, \\ndefinitions might be to the effect of \\nModel means\\n2,3 a person who poses for filmi\\nng, photography, videotaping, or recording by other means for the purpose of \\npromoting the sale or use of a product or service. Prop means\\n4 an object such as a vehicle, boat, article of clothing, food and beverage \\nproduct, or other commercial article filmed, photographed, or recorded by other means to promote its sale or use. \\nThe means of recording could be limited \\nto photography if the definitions were not \\nneeded for commercial filming. The definitio\\nns could be further simplified by replacing \\nthe mention of promoting the sale or use of \\na product or service with ﬁfor the purpose of commercial advertising.ﬂ \\nIt would be even simpler to make the \\ndefinition of commerci\\nal photography self contained, using wording to the effect of Commercial photography means the recording on film, el\\nectronic, or other media of a \\nstill image for the purpose of commercial a\\ndvertising and that uses models, props, or \\nsets that are not a part of the location™s natural or cultural resources or administrative \\nfacilities. \\nThis is essentially a restatement of 36 CFR 5.5(b), which has long worked well in \\nNational Parks, and arguably well describes the type of activity that reasonably merits \\nregulation. In that sense, this definition could serve as a mo\\ndel for other federal, state, and local jurisdictions. \\nUsing the Revised 43 CFR Part 5 \\nBecause statutory law imposes the same requirements for regulating filming and \\n\\nphotography on all DOI agencies, it would be desirable to have these activities covered by single rule throughout the DOI, simplifying matters for the agencies as well as \\n\\nfilmmakers and photographers. Toward that end, I had initially suggested that requirements for commercial filming and photogr\\naphy refer to the revised 43 CFR Part 5 proposed by the Bureau of Land Management, \\nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and \\nthe National Park Service.\\n5 But that rule seems unnece\\nssarily complex, has drawn \\n                                                 1 [36 CFR] \\n§ 5.5 Commercial\\n photography. \\n. . . \\n(b) Still photography. The taking of photographs of an\\ny vehicle, or other articles of commerce or models \\nfor the purpose of commercial adver\\ntising without a written permit from the Superintendent is prohibited. \\n2 Webster™s Third New International Dictionary\\n gives \\nmodel\\n, n. 12: one who is employed to display \\nclothes or to appear in displays of other merchandise (as in a fashion show, in a photograph, or on \\ntelevision). \\n3 Ibid., \\nmodel\\n, n. 9: . . . especially: one who poses for an artist. This definition would require a permit to \\nphotograph anyone, including family members; it makes no sense in the context of Pub. L. 106-206. \\n4 Ibid., \\nproperty\\n 4 a: any article or object used in a play or\\n motion picture except painted scenery and \\nactors™ costumes. The context of Pub. L. 106-206, and similar usage in NPS Director™s Order 53 and NPS \\nResource Manual 53, implies that the intended meaning is broader, probably the same as ﬁarticles of \\ncommerceﬂ mentioned in 36 CFR 5.5(b). \\n5 RIN 1024-AD30; this proposed revision to 43 CFR Part 5 is covered in 72 FR 46426Œ46432 ( 20 August \\n2007); I have suggested the same definitions fo\\nr this rule that I suggest for RIN 1006-AA51. \\n  Jeff Conrad  9 September 2008 \\nComments on RIN 1006ŒAA51  \\nPage 3   Jeff Conrad  9 September 2008 \\nconsiderable objection, and a revised version has not yet been proposed; the initial proposal would have fared far better if it had been based on 36 CFR 5.5(b). Recommendation It has now been more than eight years since Pub. L. 106-206 became law, and no DOI \\nagency has yet issued an implementing rule\\n; the best approach for the Bureau of Reclamation may be to define commercial \\nphotography and issue the final rule rather than to wait for another rule that ma\\ny be forthcoming from other agencies. \\nThere would be a benefit in addition to expediency: it™s much simpler to define \\ncommercial photography and require that it have authorization than to continually refer to the long description taken literally from P\\nub. L 106-206. It would also give parallel \\ntreatment to filming and photogr\\naphy, making the rule easier to follow for enforcement \\npersonnel and photographers alike. That it is \\nnatural to think of regulating ﬁcommercial \\nphotographyﬂ is evidenced by the mention of that term in the supplementary information \\nincluded with the rule proposed by the other DOI agencies. If Reclamation adopt one of the simple de\\nfinitions that I™ve suggested, perhaps the other DOI agencies will even follow Reclama\\ntion™s lead and adopt the same definition.

I am encouraged about the changes that were madeto the previous Register, but I still have some concerns.My first concern is that there is still a written time limit on the renewal of the permits even though it hasbeen extended to twenty years instead of the original five years. I wish to see the limit removed andthat the permits would be renewed in perpetuity. I know that you stated that there is intent\" to do thisbut I still don\\'t like that there is a written limit, that future employees may enforce as it is \\'literally\"written.The second concern is that it was stated that only improvements of the existing \"footprint\\' of existingbuildings on the current permit would be allowed,feel that improving the existing buildings by addingon, replacing them with larger ones or adding another structure such as a boat house would notconstitute \"new\" private exclusive use of Bureau of Reclamation land. Enlarging or adding additionalstructures within the permit area would not impact the public\\'s recreational use of Nelson Reservoir. Iwould like to request that the wording be reworded to provide existing permit holders to improve,enlarge or add structures according to the guidelines already in the existing permits.We take great pride in our permit and help \"improve\" the recreational activities by walking the shorelineand roadways around our cabin and picking up trash.My husband farms the land his grandfatherhomesteaded 100 years ago and we hoped that we could pass down the cabin permit to our own sons,likemany other permit holders have done.Sincerely,/Janeen K.

This includes, but is not limited to, boat docks, cabin sites andassociated improvements (including those currently defined in part 21 of this title), residences, trailers,manufactured or mobile homes, structures, roads, or other improvements as determined by Reclamation.Excerpted From Army Corps of EngineersSHORELINE MANAGEMENT POLICY 1130-2-406.Shoreline usesthat do not interfere with authorized project purposes, public safety concerns, violate local norms, orresult in sign ficant environmental affects should be allowed unless the public participation processidentjIes problems in these areas.Boat docks should be defined asLesser Forms of Private Useand regulated under BOR RegionalDirectors who have greater knowledge of local conditions and issues. One-size-fits-all national policies,especially for non-permanent structures like boat docks, can create unfavorable and unintentionalconsequences when theoretical policy meets local reality.In its attempt to ease its administrative duties, the BOR has lumped boat docks in with permanentstructures such as cabins and roads under its definition ofPrivate Exclusive Uses,resulting in heavy-handed regulation of lesser structures not replicated by other agencies. For example, the Army Corps ofEngineers defines docks as\"lesser forms of private use\"and grandfather\\'s their existence as long as theyare in\"useable and safe condition,\"do not present a\"threat to life or property,\"and the holder of thepermitis in\"substantial compliance with the existing permit.\"We are owners of a community dock on Lake Cascade and we feel that Recreational uses of BORwaterways should be governed under regional offices that are knowledgeable about localconditions and issues. One-size-fits-all policies often create unintended negative consequences.Defining boat docks asLesser Forms of Private Useis consistent with other regulatory agenciesand eliminates the heavy-handed impact of regulating boat docks under the same guidelines aspermanent structures likes cabins and roads.Sincerely,Orson and Charlotte Woodhouse1326 Prairie View DriveEagle, Idaho 83616Property Owners Doimelly, IdahoSeptember 9, 2008Bureau of ReclamationDenver Federal CenterP0 Box 25007Denver, CO 80225-0007ATTN: Richard Rizzi, Mail Code: 84-53000RE:BOR-2008-0004/Permit Transfer43 CFR Part 429: Use of Bureau of Reclamation Land, Facilities, and WaterbodiesMr. Rizzi:The following is our opinion on the below proposed rule citation:§ 429.30Your use authorization may not be transferred or assigned to others without priorwritten approval of Reclamation, unless specifically providedfor in your use authorization.Should you wish to transfer or assign your use authorization to another individual or entity,you must contact the Reclamation office that issued your use authorization prior to takingsuch action.As written, the proposed rule does not recognize homeowners\\' rights to transfer their dockpermits should they sell their lakeside homes or pass them on to their heirs.

Any such renewalswill be subject to the periodic review described in subsection (b) [above], and these reviews couldpotentially result in the termination of the use agreement prior to the end of the term of years.The term forcompliance reviews [429.32 (b)],especially when applied to docks,is unnecessarily briefand should be expanded from5to 20 years. In addition, compliance language should be clarified to directthat compliance reviews for docks be done on a lake-wide basis since individual dock compliance willoccur at permit renewal.The term for permitrenewals [429.32 (e)], is confusing and requires clarification.

Rule languageshould clearly reflect that intent.We are owners of a community dock on Lake Cascade and we feel that mandating BOR offices toconduct compliance reviews for docks every5years:places an unnecessary financial and administrative burden on regional offices, andencourages rubber stamping of previous reviews.Expanding the compliance review period toat least once every 20 years:reflects a more reasonable time period in which lake-wide situations may change,allows for more frequent reviews if circumstances warrant, andencourages more thorough reviews when they do occur.Conducting compliance reviews on a lake-wide basis appropriately focuses attention on overall lakeconditions and the impact of all docks.

Conversely, requests forrenewal, transfer, extension, or reissuance of use authorizations for private exclusiverecreational or residential uses that were in existence on the effective date of these regulationsand that are in compliance with all requirements of the applicable use authorization at the time arequest is made will not be considered requests far uses prohibited under §429.31, with transfersand assignments of such use authorizations being subject to the requirements of §429. 30.As written, the proposed rule places no requirement on the BOR to inform permit holders of expiringpermits. Lack of such notice, combined with the rule\\'s clear prohibition against reinstatement of lapsedpermits, results in permanent loss of docks for unaware homeowners who miss renewal deadlines.Rule language should be modified to require permit issuing BOR offices to mail notice of expiringpermits to addresses of record at least 90 days prior to such expirations.We are owners of a community dock on Lake Cascade and we feel that BOR officials have been clear intheir desire to place obtaining permit renewals solely on the backs of permit holders. Given the enormouspenalty for missing a renewal date - permanent loss of one\\'s dock - lack of any notice requirement on thepart of BOR appears to be one more blatant attempt to remove lake docks one by one.By rule, BOR offices issuing permits should be required to notify permit holders in writing to theiraddress of record at least 90 days prior to permit expiration dates.BOR offices issuing permits should be given discretionary authority to reinstate lapsed permits whereholders can show lack of notice or other extenuating circumstances00OUOrson and Charlotte Woodhouse1326Prairie View DriveEagle, Idaho 83616September 9, 2008Bureau of ReclamationDenver Federal CenterP0 Box 25007Denver, CO 80225-0007ATTN: Richard Rizzi, Mail Code: 84-53000RE:BOR-2008-0004.IDeficiency Cure Period43 CFR Part 429: Use of Bureau of Reclamation Land, Facilities, and WaterbodiesMr. Rizzi:The following is regarding our opinion on the below proposed rule citation:§429.32 (b)Reclamation will review all existing private exclusive recreational or residential uses forcompliance with the required criteria at least once every 5 years. Reclamation will provide the holder ofthe use authorization with written report of the results of the compliance review. The report will statewhether the existing use meets the required criteria listed in this section and will list any deficiencies thatcan be corrected. A minimum of 90 days will be provided to make corrections identified in the report.Failure to correct the deficiencies within the time provided in the report will result in termination of theuse authorization.Dock owners notified of deficiencies in their docks currently would have as little as 90 days to correctthose deficiencies before losing their permits. Further, no allowance is made for reinstatement of dockpermits once revoked, regardless of whether deficiencies are corrected.We are owners of a community dock on Lake Cascade and we feel that Ninety days is too short to repaira dock. Any dock inadequacies noted in October might not be repairable until late spring because thelake is frozen or inaccessible. Changing the minimum period to make corrections to 270 days wouldbetter recognize the seasonal nature of waterways like Lake Cascade and the limited pool of availablecontractors.Dock owners are willing to repair their docks; they just need a reasonable amount of time inwhich to do so.Lake docks can now cost upwards of$15,000. The financial impact of replacing a dock or making costlyrepairs may be onerous for some when limited to a 90-day window. A 270-day period would better allowfor meeting the sometimes significant financial obligation of required improvements.There are many ways a dock owner can lose his or her dock, many of which are traps for the unwary. Forexample, if a family shares a cabin and dock permit and Uncle Bob is in charge of the permit fees - and ifUncle Bob drops the ball and fails to pay the permit fee - the whole family loses the dock permit. Aprovision should be added to the rule that if the permit holder or his successor cures the problem thatcaused the dock permit to be forfeited within five years of the forfeiture (such as by paying the delinquentbill), the dock permit will be reinstated. In the alternative, a provision should be added to allow forsituations that merit local BOR.Sincerely,dhe Woo',\n",

Some are waiting until theyretire or until their personal finances permit them to spend the monies necessary to construct a dock.There are some destructive storms on the lake that damage docks.

One-size-fits-all national policies,especially for non-permanent structures like boat docks, can create unfavorable and unintentionalconsequences when theoretical policy meets local reality.\"\"In its attempt to ease its administrative duties, the BOR has lumped boat docks in with pennanentstructures such as cabins and roads under its definition of Private Exclusive Uses, resulting in heavy-handed regulation of lesser structures not replicated by other agencies. For example, the Army Corps ofEngineer defmes docks as \"lesser forms of private use\" and grandfather\\'s their existence as long as they arein \"usable and safe condition,\" do not present a \"threat to life or property,\" and the holder of the permit isin \"substantial compliance with the existing permit.\"Proposed Rule Citations-429.2 Defmitions. Private exclusive recreational or residential use means any use that involves structuresor other improvements used for recreational or residential purposed to the exclusion of public uses or whichcreate the perception of such exclusion and are not associated with the official management of aReclamation project.This includes, but in not limited to Boat docks, cabin sites, and associatedimprovements(including those currently defined in part 21 of this title), residences, trailer, manufactured ormovable homes, structures, roads, or other improvements as determined by Reclamation.Excerpted From Army Corps of Engineers Shoreline Management Policy 1130-2-4-6 Shoreline uses thatdo not interfere with authorized project purposes, public safety concerns, violate local norms, or result insignificant environmental affects should be allowed unless the public participation process identifiesproblems in these areas.Recreational uses of BR waterways should be governed under regional offices that are knowledgeable boutlocal conditions and issues. One-size-fits-all policies often create unintended negative consequences.Suggested Change:As stated by a friend, defining boat docks as Lesser Forms of Private Use is consistent with otherregulatory agencies and eliminates the heavy-handed impact of regulating boat docks under the sameguidelines as permanent structures like cabins and roads.I am asking for these changes to 43 CFR Part 429: Use of Bureau of Reclamation Land, Facilities, andWaterbodies.4L-IJEileen Cirillo9801 Westview Dr.Boise, ID 83704CC: Senator Mike CrapoRepresentative Bill SaliState Senator - District 8 Lee HeinrichState Representative - District 8 Ken RobertsSenator Larry CraigRepresentative Mike SimpsonDirk Kempthorne, Secretary of InteriorGovenor Butch OtterMr. J.

Box 25007Denver, CO 80225-0007Sacramento, CA 95825Re: 1 006-AA51 - Coments on Proposed Rule on 43 CFR Part 429Dear Mr. Rizzi,The Sierra Club has over 800,000 members. The Recreation Issues ConlTirttee cootdinates theSierra Club\\'s conservation efforts on recreation issues.Recreation issues of concern to usindude, but are not Irnited to: use conflicts, noise !npacts, appropriate and accessible recreation,resource protection from recreation rnpacts, recreation fees and pnvatization of recreation onpublic lands.These corrrnents focus on the proposed changes to § 429.32 in the Notice of ProposedRulemaking published in the Federal Register (vol. 73, no. 139, p. 42236, July 18, 2008)involving private exclusive recreational or residential uses. However, they should not beconstrued as indicating support for any other changes proposed in this rulemaking.SUMMARY CONCLUSIONSThe proposed rules provide no rationale to which the public can respond for reversing theregulations that were proposed in July 2007. In addition, the new rule contradicts mandatoryReclamation policy and is unlawful given Reclamation\\'s mandate to provide for public recreation.Reda-nalion should look for guidance to other Dept. of the Interior agendes that are faang thisissue.REQUESTSBased upon the discussion below, we ask that Reclamation:(i)Seek a soliator\\'s opinion on the legality of permits for private, exdusive use,(ii)Provide information on all instances of exdusive use by location, including a descnption ofthe type of exclusive use, whether it is permitted directly by Reclamation, through a privateconcessionaire or an agency partner, the length of the the exclusive use has beenoutstanding, the expiration date, and whether the use was permitted or renewed in violation ofcurrent policy, and(iii)In light of (i) and (ii) above, either withdraw or re-notice and reconsider this rulemaking, in arulemaking process that corrects the gross procedural flaws of the current process byRECREATION ISSUES COMMITTEESierra Club85Second St. #2SanFrancisco, CA 94105415 977-5500September 12, 2008addressing the question of legality,analyzing the budget inpact,providing a rationale for the proposal, andgiving notice equally to all parties where there is reasonable cause to believe theparties have an interest in this matter, specifically including all those who corrrnentedon the exdusive use/private trailer issue in connection with the 2006 dedsion on LakeBerryessa and organizations known to have an interest in recreation on public lands.BACKGROUNDThe Bureau of Reclamation has created and now manages many reservoirs prrnanly in thewestern part of the U.S., that supply drinking water to thirsty citizens, irrigation for crops, floodprotection and hydroelectric power.Recreation was not part of Redamation\\'s original mandate,but the natural attraction of humans to bodies of water for swirrrning, boating, hiking around, orjust sitting and contemplating as a means of refreshing one\\'s soul, means that Reclamation hashad to address public recreational use and access to its reservoirs.As acknowledged in therulemaking, demand for access to Redamation fadlities is growing:The demand for use of Reclamation land, facilities, and waterbodies for many different kinds ofactivities has increased dramatically since Reclamation began building Federal water supply, floodcontrol and hydropower projects over 100 years ago. (p. 42236)We understand that Reclamation has 310 designated recreation areas that attract more than 90million visits a year. Rising population and higher levels of travel are causing that figure toincrease yearly by more than a million visits.Unlike other agencies with recreationresponsibilities whose land holdings include millions of acres and are increasing, Reclamation\\'srecreation lands are strictly limited, generally to a narrow strip of land around a reservoir, and arenot growing because new reservoirs are not being built. As a consequence of the rising demandfor Fniited and finite resources, access to Reclamation land and waterbodies is becomingincreasingly precious.According toRecreation Management Activities At Selected Sites, Bureau of Redamation,Dept. ofthe Interior, Office of the Inspector General Audit Report No. 95-1-870, May 1995, p.2:In the mid-i 960\\'s, the private, exclusive use of Federal project lands for recreational dwellingsbecame the subject of controversy. In 1965, the Secretary of the Interior responded with aproposal to phase out private cabin sites on Department of the Interior lands, in part to ensure thatthese areas did not become permanently dedicated to private use to the detriment or exclusion ofpossible future public uses. In a letter published in the Federal Register dated July 15, 1965, theSecretary stated that the phaseout was \"essential to assure the availability of public recreationareas for public use.As a result, policies were adopted, applicable first to recreation managed directly by Reclamationand then to recreation managed by agency partners and private concessionaires which called forexclusive use to be elmnated \"as soon as possible\" (LND P02, §3.F, \"Exclusive use of theFederal estate will not be allowed and existing exclusive use will be removed as soon aspossible\").That is the mandatory policy today.Reports and audits over the years confirm that exclusive use has been a problem, not onlybecause it excludes the public from recreational access, but because Reclamation does not havethe staff or budget to ensure compliance with health, safety, and environmental standards and asa consequence violations are coninon.The poster child for everything wrong with exclusive use is Lake Berryessa in California.However, Reclamation established a goal to \"remedy over four decades of management practiceunder which prrne recreational areas have been reserved for long term trailer site pernittees, to2the exclusion of the majority of visitors to Lake Berryessa.\" FEIS,Future Reoreat/on Use andOperations of Lake Berryessa, October 2005 (p. 33). Finally, after a multi-year bruising battlewith those who sought to retain their private, exdusive use permits, involving two extensionsand then a re-opening of the public corrment period, numerous lawsuits in all of whichReclamation prevailed, and enormous support from the public, conservation and recreationorganizations, elected officials and local government, Reclamation issued the Reconi of Decision in2006 that confirmed all private, exclusive use vacation sites would be removed.Reclamation now proposes to reverse its policy and to retain all existing exclusive use.Discussion1 .The proposed rule provides no rationale for reversing the regulations proposed in2007 andcontradicting mandatory Reclamation policy.The regulations proposed on July 18, 2007 rnplemented mandatory Redamalion policy thatrequires exdusive use to be elimnated as soon as possible. An exception was created thatwould allow the Commissioner to waive the policy, an exception we believe was not lawful.The 2008 proposed rulemaking reverses the 2007 proposal, with no explanation, rationale, oreven a dear acknowledgement that it is doing so. Nor is there any acknowledgement orexplanation offered for why a rule would be proposed that contradicts a long-standing mandatoryReclamation policy. The sole explanation offered is simply that there was an overwheningreaction to the proposed rule:Comment:Support was expressed for the proposed changes to the current rule and would like tosee more private exclusive use areas converted to public use areas.Response:Due to the overwhelming reaction received during the comment period, we havereconsidered this issue. (co?..73, \\'t\\'.P. No. 139,it.42237)This is not a reasoned response, nor does it provide the public with any rationale to which it canrespond, depriving interested parties of a fair opportunity to understand and comment on therulemaking.The lack of a reasoned response and adequate explanation is all the more confusing because it isinconsistent with the overwhekning weight of Redarnalion\\'s own experience, plus reports, auditsand recent public criticism which it has recently received in connection with the Lake Berryessadecision.Nor has Reclamation provided any information that would allow the public to assess the impact ofthis regulation by reporting on the number, type and location of private exclusive uses that areoutstanding In the absence of any such information, we cannot assess thepact of thisproposed regulation. Indeed, we understand that even Reclamation does not know how manyprivate, exclusive uses there are on its own land and waterbodies. The lack of information onthis issue deprives us and the public in general of a fair opportunity to comment on thisrulemaking.2.The proposedrulewould violate Reclamation\\'s Congressional mandate to providefor public recreation, is in excess of Reclamation\\'s statutory junsdictionandauthority,and is unlawful.We understand that Reclamation will be receiving from the Napa Sierra Club,for the third tine,acopy of an April 3, 2006 legal opinion by Shute, Mihaly & Weinberger, LLP in San Franciscowhich points out that allowing private exclusive use is unlawful. Although some of the statutescited in that opinion relate specifically to Lake Berryessa, others apply to Reclamation\\'s generalauthority. For your convenience, we repeat some of the legal condusions and analysis:3Statutory Provisions Mandate that Reclamation Provide Recreattonal Opportunities to theGeneral Public, a Mandate Antithetical to Exclusive Private Use.In 1965, the Federal Water Project Recreation Act added a recreational element . . . 16 U.S.C. §4601-12. The Act authorized the Secretary of the Interior, in conjunction to the construction or controlof any reservoir, to investigate, plan, construct, operate and maintain, or otherwise provide forpub/icoutdoorrecreationand fish and wildlife enhancement facilities, to acquire or otherwise make availablesuch adjacent lands or interests therein as are necessary forpublic outdoor recreationor fish andwildlife use, and to provide forpublic use and enjoymentof project lands, facilities, and water areas in amanner coordinated with the other project purposes. 16 U.S.C. § 4601-18(a); emphasis added. TheSecretary was authorized, in particular, to enter into agreements with federal, state and local agenciesto \\'best promote the development and operation of such lands or facilitiesin the public interest forrecreation and fish and wildlife enhancement purposes.\" 16 U.S.C. § 4601-18(b): emphasis added.The legal opinion also conduded that \"the expenditure of appropriated funds for continuedexclusive use is not authorized.\"The proposed rulemaking cites Section 10 of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 (43 U.S.C§387), which is described as \"providing the Secretary the authority, in his discretion, to grantleases, licenses, easements, and rights-of-way.\"Combined with Section 10 of the ReclamationAct of June 17, 1902 (43 U.s.c. §373), which grants authority to the Secretary of the Interior toissues rules to carry out that Act, it is claimed that these two rules grant Reclamation the \"generalauthority to issue rules on authorizing or prohibiting use of Reclamation land, facilities, andwaterbodies.\" Fed. Reg., vol 73, no. 139, p.42236.Whether singly or combined, these statutes do not grant Reclamation unfettered discretion toallow use of its land in violation of its other authorizing statutes. Indeed, the Act of 1939 not onlylimits any licenses,etc.,issued to those that are not incompatible with the purposes for which thelands are administered, but requires that the Secretary of the Interior specifically make a judgmentto that effect:Such permits or grants shall be made only when, in the judgment of the Secretary, their exercisewill not be incompatible with the purposes for which the lands or interests in lands are beingadministered, and shall be on such terms and conditions as in his judgment will adequately protectthe interests of the United States and the project for which said lands or interests in lands arebeing administered. Section 10(43 U.S.C 387) of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939.Acoording to the Office of the Inspector General (1995 Audit Report no. 95-1-870, p. 2), theSecretary of the Interior in fact has found that exclusive use is incompatible with providing forpublic recreation and determined to phase out privately owned dwellings to ensure that theseareas \"did not become permanently dedicated to private use to the detriTent or exclusion ofpossible future public uses.\"We are aware of no such countermanding finding by the Secretaryof the Interior that would support a decision that existing private exclusive use is compatible withRedaTlation\\'s mandate to provide for public recreation use.Reclamation has been given no authorization from congress to provide private exclusiverecreation uses and such uses in fact violate statutory mandates to provide for public recreationaluse.The proposed regulation is unlawful.3.Thecreationof a new bureaucratic process will have a significant impact onReclamation\\'s budget which needs to be analyzed.The new regulations require that each and every private exclusive use permittee be providedwith a report every five years that addresses compliance in five different areas. In order toprepare those reports Redamation will need to assess security needs, determine if the use iscompatible with project purposes, operations and public needs, determine if the use complieswith environmental requirements, determine if there are any public health or safety issues, and4confirm whether the permittee is current in their financial obligations. Reclamation is required toprovide the permitte with notice of any deficiencies, which triggers a 90 day period to correct.There are even more requirements and a public process is mandated to support any finding that aprivate exclusive use is not compatible with public needs. This can require such reports andstudies as a resource management plan development, rea-eation demand analysis studies, andproject feasibility studies.Reports are also required again within 6 months of any exclusivepermit expiration date.We believe that the number of private uses outstanding on Reclamation lands is likely in thethousands. There can be no question that the massive number of reports and studies requiredwill have a significant financial inpact on Reclamation\\'s budget. This impact needs to beanalyzed prior to the adoption of a process that will have such a significant mpact.4.Thewlemdngprocess wascarriedoutina manner calculated toinfonnand involveprimarily thosewhosupport private, exclusive usewhilewithholding notice from thoseReclamation had reason to know opposed exclusive use.We understand that notice of the 2007 rulemaking was sent to thousands of persons who hadexclusive use permits and could therefore be presumed to support private exclusive use.Whatis surprising is that notice was not given to the hundreds and hundreds of persons Reclamationhad reason to believe opposed exclusive use. These are the persons, organizations and localagencies that submitted coments opposing exclusive use trailer sites in connection with the2006 decision on Lake Berryessa. We are unaware of any person or organization that opposedexclusive use in the Lake Berryessa process that received notice of this rulemaking.Itwould appear that the targeted notice process was repeated with the 2008 rulemaking. Thefailure to provide notice of the 2008 rulemaking to known opponents of exclusive use is evenmore egregious in that a local Sierra Club executive corrrnittee member specifically requestedsuch notice. In fact, the Napa Sierra Club sent a letter to Corrrnissioner Johnson on June 27,2008, with a copy to you, regarding their concern that the regulations proposed in 2007 were notlegal.Even that expression of opposition to exclusive use failed to get the Napa Sierra Club onthe distribution list for notice of this 2008 rulemaking.Providing notice only to those on one side of an issue is a gross violation of proceduralrequirements that deprives the public of a fair opportunity to corirnent on the proposedrulemaking.5.Reclamation should be looking to other Department of the interior agencies, andrecommendations from the inspector General, for guidance on addressing this issue.The Bureau of Reclamation is not only agency of the Department of the Interior that has issuedexclusive use permits of questionable legality.The Office of the Inspector General of theDepartment of the Interior in Audit Report No. W-IN-MOA-0008-2005,Pnvate Use of PublicLands, National Park Service and Bureau of Land Management found that the National PaikService,April 2007 (p. 3, transmittal letter) found that the National Park Servicehas allowed private individuals or exclusive clubs to monopolize desirable locations nearmajor metropolitan areas for decades to the exclusion of the general public, although wecould not identify the extent of this permitting.The 2007 audit report points out that the legality of the National Park Service\\'s practice ofissuing permits for private exclusive use that excluded public access was questioned byOffice of the Inspector General 23 yearsAt that time the OIG reconiriended the NPS5seek a legal opinion on the issue. The 2007 audit report confirms (p.5) that therecormiended legal opinion was never requested.The 2007 OIG audit report recorrinended that the NPS open facilities having exclusive useto the general public. The NPS concurred with the reconmenda1ions and indicated in a letterattached to the audit report that it would initiate a survey of all park units, requesting thatthey provide a list of all long-term permits issued to an individual, group or organization thathave the potential for liting public access to park lands.CONCLUSIONThe proposed rulemaking has deprived the public of a fair opportunity to coninent by providingno rationale or reasoned explanation for reversing earlier proposed regulations. The proposedrules violate Redamalion policy, are antithetical to the mandate to provide for public recreation andare unlawful.Reclamation needs to address the legality of what it is proposing and provide thepublic with information on the extent of private exclusive use. Should Reclamation thereafterwish to proceed with a rulemaking, it needs to correct the gross procedural violations that haveoccurred with the July 2008 rulemaking, analyze the budge rnpact of its proposals, provide arationale for any changes to current policy that are proposed, and provide equal notice to thoseon both sides of the issue.We look forward to your response to these conynents.Sincerely,cCRosalind McClellan2008 Chair303-447-9409mcclelr@colorado.edu',\n",

Box458Donnelly, Idaho 83615(Unilateral BOR Termination Powers43 CFRPart4291.I agree that agency decisions to terminate existing use rights should always beexamined through a public review process involving individuals affected by the decisionas well as their local elected leaders.3.Determinations of \"incompatibility\" or a \"higher public use\" should not be left todistant bureaucrats.Here again, broad public comment should be required.4.I object to the freedom granted \"applicable Federal, State, and local laws, regulations,ordinances.. .\"This would seem to deprive a home owner of discretionary use of theproperty adjacent to a dock./OO?A-2 Year Use or Lose Clause43 CFR Part 429I have several disagreements with the Issue Statement if I am reading it correctly.Whatis \"presumption of abandonment?\" Does it give the BOR authority to do whatever itdecides regarding an existing dock?It does not seem fair to me to give the BOR freedom to cause an owners losing a dockforever.I-low can the BOR issue a time schedule to a cabin owner regarding installation of adock?I do not understand the \"nonuse\" period. Who will determine this?Will a BORrepresentative monitor the times a dock is in use?It does not seem that the BOR should have the power of revoking a valid permit, norremoving docks at their discretion.IooPfktLocal Control for Lesser Forms or Private Use43 CFR Part 429I think that recreational uses of BOR waterways should be governed under regionaloffices that are knowledgeable about local conditions and issues. One-size-fits-allpolicies can often create unintended negative consequences.Defining oat docks as Lesser Forms of Private Use is consistent with other regulatoryagencies and eliminates the heavy-handed impact of regulating boat docks under the sameguidelines as permanent structures like cabins and roads.j/(16Permit Transfer43 CFR Part 4291.I believe that a homeowner should have the right to transfer his dock with propertyownership. In my particular instance, my home is built adjacent to the lake, and is onproperty that has been in our family for many years, 87 in my instance. I think I shouldbe allowed to transfer it to my offspring at my death.IO_Harsh Penalties & Fines43 CFR Part 42291.What are we coming to? It seems very excessive to me to issue such harsh penaltiesfor something as small as a dock!! Perhaps, in a small number of instances, some form ofcorrectional measures are appropriate. These as stated seem excessive, to say nothing ofthe interest accrued.(2Compliance Review & Permit Renewal Periods43CRF Part 4291.Reviewing docks every five years would, I think, place an unnecessary burden onBOR.2.I think that 20 year compliance reviews would be better than every five years.Landscaping43 CFR Part429I am one citizen that was here before Cascade Dam was built creating this lake. Land thatwas not for sale was condenmed and price established by BOR. There are places wherethe lake is undercutting private land. The BOR should be protecting that rather thanhaving individuals do so.How can there be controls on what grows around a cabin site. . . and that is on privateland?Renewal Notice43 CFR Part 429This reads in such a way that the BOR would need scarcely any excuse to deny the use ofa boat dock to anyone it chose to eliminate. Does this allow the BOR unnecessarypower?Would it be appropriate to refer to our Constitution.. . .WE THE PEOPLE?',\n",

The downside of such a provision in the rule is that it makes impossiblefor local managers to live up to the BOR land policy principles which state the agencyshould \"fulfill Reclamations stewardship responsibility by providing appropriaterecreational opportunities, facilities, and services on Reclamation land and water.\"At Lake Cascade there are many instances where new docks are a good idea, for accessand safety of all users of the lake.The limiting of no new docks will cause the publicfacilities to even become more overrun by too many people needing to access the lakeand park their cars and boat trailers.This provision should be removed from the rule in favor of the good judgment of thelocal Reclamation managers.

Box 25007Denver, Co 80225-0007Subject:Federal Register Notice, Proposed Rule 43 CFR, Part 429,Use of Bureau of Reclamation Land, Facilities, and WaterbodiesTo Whom It May Concern:Thank you for hosting the very information meeting in Malta on Wednesday, August 20,2008.We are writing in reference to the proposed changes to the Federal Register during thiscomment period to September 16, 2008.Our understanding is that existing use authorizations for private cabin sites are defmedand governed under Part 21 of the CFR but are also referenced under the proposedrevisions of Part 429. If the cabin sites on Nelson Reservoir are governed under Part 21according to the most recently revised Permit for Seasonal Recreation Sites dated May5,2006, please clarify that Part 429 will not supersede those existing permits whenrenewed.If in fact we are governed under Part 429 after this comment period expires, werespectfully request that clarity of § 429.31 under Subpart H - Prohibited andUnauthorized Uses of Reclamation Land, Facilities, and Waterbodies.Whereby thewording includes all new private exclusive recreational or residentialuse.Werespectfully request that existing private exclusive recreational or residential useauthorizations not be construed to include new private exclusive use.At the meeting, we were told the interpretation of this rule was that work within theexisting \"footprint\" of the existing buildings on the existing permit sites is allowed withBOR approval. However, if we were applying to expand the \"footprint\" by enlarging theexisting cabin or adding a storage shed, this would be considered \"new\" private exclusiveSeptember 12, 2008Page 2use and would not be allowed.When further interpretation was questioned, the responsewas directed to our area managers in Billings, who indicated they would review theapplications on a case by case basis.We would like to state that in our opinion, alldecisions regarding this Region, or any other, should remain in the Area Officeoverseeing those projects and permits.Itwould be helpful for those of us who have existing permits and who might want toimprove our cabins or request an additional shed on the site, have the BOR clearly defmetheir interpretation between \"new\" and \"existing\" uses in the Federal Register.By adding additional structures or enlarging ones existing on an already in-use permittedsite would not result in \"new\" private exclusive use of BOR land. Most sites on NelsonReservoir are on approx .10 of an acre and enlarging or adding additional structureswould have absolutely no impact to public recreational opportunities at Nelson Reservoir,but would improve the public\\'s perception of what this area and reservoir has to offer.Very SincerelyL)Gary and Barbara AndersonP0 Box 1622Malta, MT59538cc:US Senator Max BaucusUS Senator Jon TesterUS Representative Denny Rehberg',\n",

It has been an important part of keeping the family together fromgeneration to generation. Considering this family use, the cabin was recently rebuilt.The proposed rule will adversely impact continuation of this practice.I attended the informational meeting held August 20, 2008 at Malta, Montana. Iappreciate the presentations and questions/answer process at that meeting. However, Ihave the following comments:A. For rural and less populated areas such as northeastern Montana, the proposedrule runs counter to the stated purpose of promoting public use and high qualityrecreational opportunities and represents management practices that are not in the bestinterests of the government.The past practice of granting - and then regularly extending - private exclusiveresidential use authorizations encouraged public investment by local residents. Localresidents tend to have a greater stake in becoming and do become responsible users andcaretakers.Responsible users and caretakers are required to develop and maintain highquality recreational opportunities.The proposed rule, with its provisions prohibiting new improvements and subjectingexisting improvements to vague criteria, will eliminate this local user encouragementand, in turn, reduce the chances for developing a high quality recreational location. TheU.S. Government\\'s interest is better served with long-term renewal or privatization ofresidential use areas.B.The proposed rule allows for existing p:lvate exclusive recreational andresidential uses to remain provided certain criteria are met. The listed criteria include (1)compatibility with authorized project purposes. project operations, safety and security;(2) compatibility with public needs; (3) environmental compliance; (4) public health andsafety; and(5)current in financial obligation. 429.32(a). Critical parts of this criteria arevague.The term \"compatibility\" implies that a use is capable of existing together in harmonywith other uses. What are the factors for deteri ining this \"compatibility\"? The proposedrule should require consideration of all relevant factors, including but not limited toduration of use, type of use and willingness of user to make appropriate adjustment.The terms, \"authorized project purposes\" and \"project operations,\" are not defined.Who is the \"authorizing\" body or agency? How are \"project purposes\" defined? Whatconstitutes \"project operations\"?What are th applicable standards for \"safety\" or\"security\" in criteria (1)?What is the distinction between \"safety\" in criteria (1) and\"public safety\" in criteria (4)?The definition of \"public needs\" in criteria 2) includes the vague terms \"recreationalrequirements of the general public\" and \"areas where existing ... use authorizations arepresent.\" Just what are the \"recreational requirements of the general public?\"Whatdefines the \"areas\" where these requirements would exist? 429.2C.The definition of the term, \"private exclusive recreational or residential use,\" istoo broad. The proposed rule would require use authorizations to annually launch amovable/floating dock or to use roads to enter abin sites. At the informational meeting,BOR personnel indicated that movable/floating docks would not be restricted but theproposed rule gives no such assurance. 429.2D.The proposed rule calls for no \"new private exclusive recreational or residentialuse.\" This term could include remodel, tear down and rebuild, and expansion. Again, atthe informational meeting, BOR personnel indicated that improvements within the samefootprint will not be considered a \"new\" use but the proposed rule gives no suchassurance. 429.31E.The proposed rule calls for terminatioii f a use authorization if corrective actionis not done in a minimum of 90 days. Further, upon nonrenewal or termination, thegrantee must remove improvements within 90 lays. Given the shorter constructionseason of northern states, this 90 day period will not always be adequate. The proposedrule needs to give users assurance this time period can be extended for good cause.429.32(b)(d)(f)F.The proposed rule calls for the \"Regional Director\" to make determinations,including renewal decisions and those based on \"fair and efficient administration\" of therule.At the informational meeting, BOR persunnel indicated that these decisions wouldbe made at the state level but there is no such assurance in the proposed rule, Rather,2\"Regional Director\" can be construed to allow a Regional Director from any of5regionsto make those decisions. 429.32(c)(g), 429.34, 429.2G.The proposed rule allows for 20 year maximum renewal of use authorizations,subject to periodic review at least once every5years.The 20 year time period is notadequate. The public use and the quality of that use is better promoted by a longer periodor, at the least, the continuation of existing permit practice that grants users the option torenew. 429.32(e)H.The proposed rule provides BOR may unilaterally terminate a use authorizationfor failure to use and a presumption of abandonment exist on failure to construct or usefor any continuous 2-year period. To avoid this presumption, the proposed rule needs tooutline a procedure for construction/use documentation. 429.28(4)I.The proposed rule calls for BOR decisions to be sent to the applicant/user bymail.BOR may not always have the right user address. The mere deposit in the mail isnot adequate. This provision should require certified mail, return receipt requested.429.34(a). Likewise, the 30 day appeal period should commence on date of receipt,rather than date of the determination letter.429.35.Thank you for the opportunity to respond.Sincerely Yours,Maureen E.

Box25007Denver, CO 80225-0007Re: Revised Proposed Rule Comment ID: 1 006-AA5 IDear Mr. Rizzi:This letter responds to the Bureau of Reclamation\\'s request for comments specific to therevised Proposed Public Rule 43 CFR 429 (comment number 1 006AA5 1) titled Use ofBureau of Reclamation Land, Facilities, and Waterbodies. Specifically, these commentsaddress the revised rules published on July 18,2008.As homeowners on Idaho\\'s Lake Cascade, we appreciate the fact that the Bureau hasrevised the original proposed rule and provided us with an opportunity to comment on therevised proposed rule.We believe that while the revised rule addressed many of ourconcerns, it still has elements that we feel need to be adjusted. Listed below aresuggested changes to the proposed rule that we feel will fairly address the use ofReclamation land.1.Sec 429.31 (b)( 1 )(ii):This section still prohibits new dock permits from beingissued to those who do not currently have a dock permit on Lake Cascade.This prohibition should be eliminated on LakeCascade.We feel thisrestriction is not in keeping with the objective of making the lake accessible tothe public for the followingreasons:Lake Cascade currently does not have adequate launch facilities or mooring sitesto accommodate the current day use visitors. Launch sites are not well locatedand have inadequate parking for tow vehicles. To prevent new docks would noteliminate competition for these limited facilities at the launch sites and continueto reduce public access.2.Sec 429.30 states that the use authorization may not be transferred or assignedto a future owner without prior written approval of Reclamation.We requestthat the right to transfer the use authorization to a new property ownerbe specificallystatedas a right as long as all of the other use criteria aremet.When we purchased our home in 1995 we relied on a letter from JerroldD. Gregg, project superintendent and a representative of the Bureau ofReclamation, dated 1988 to the previous owner that advised new dock permitswould be offered to those docks then underpermit andthat\\'inthe event ofsale or other transferof propertyat Cascade thepermitmay be assigned to thenew owner.\"This letter was relied on in our determination of the purchaseprice of this property and if this rule were changed we would suffer aneconomic loss as a direct result of this misrepresentation by the Bureau ofReclamation.3.Sec 429.28(a)(4) states \"failure to construct or use for a continuous 2-yearperiod may constitute a presumption of abandonment of the requested use andcause termination\",This sentence should be deleted from the revisedproposed rule.Many property owners could be hurt by this proposed rule.There are manysituations, which could lead to the loss of a use permit that are not in the controlof the property owner. Illness or age might prevent the use of a dock permit for aperiod in excess of 2-years and if all other use fees and requirements of use aremet the individual should not be subjected to loss of the permit that would be usedin the future by family members or a new owner.4.Sec 429.23 states \"The use fee is based on a valuation or by competitivebidding\".Use fees should be reasonableand basedon local situations. Aspecific method of determining fees should be added here.Use fees for docks on Lake Cascade have increased substantially in past years. Inthis lake the ability to use a dock is subject to the water level that fluctuatesgreatly as water is used for other purposes. In the last several years the waterlevel has dropped so rapidly that docks are sitting on the sand in the middle ofAugust. This only allows use for approximately a 2-month period from themiddle of June to the middle of August. Fees should take this limited use intoconsideration.We understand and support the Bureau of Reclamation\\'s commitment to make itswaterways available to all people, and we believe the current regulations in placeaccomplish that goal.We encourage the Bureau not to put restrictions into the proposedrule that would reduce the use of this water body.We urge you to continue the existing public/private partnership currently in place at LakeCascade and to adjust the proposed rule to address the above issues.Stanley andusanomande8325 Wyndliam LaneBoise, ID 83704cc:Dirk Kempthorne, Secretary of Interiorcc:Governor Butch Ottercc:Rep Bill Salicc: State Senator Lee Heinrichcc: State Rep Ken Roberts',\n",
       "  '5September 2008Richard Rizzi, Mail Code: 84-53000Bureau of Reclamation, Denver Federal CenterP0 Box 25007Denver, CO. 80225-0007Dear Mr. Rizzi,Re: 1006-AA5IWe object to the latest proposed ruling regarding Lake Cascade in Idaho, in particular theregulations regarding private boat docks.We are upset that the BOR proposes to havethe authority to unilaterally terminate private docks using a vaguely defined set ofcircumstances. Terminating existing use rights should always be via a public process,involving local people, not government officials in Washington DC or elsewhere.The proposed reasons for dock use termination are give the BOR much too broad latitudeto initiate such actions. A \"one size fits all\" approach is not appropriate.We purchased our lakefront lot on Lake Cascade approximately 3 years ago with theintent of building a retirement home there. This is not financially possible for us at thistime but we will be able to do this in a few years. it makes no sense to force us to installa boat dock on an empty lot in order to avoid the \"2 year presumption of abandonment\"rule.We have regularly paid our rather large annual boat dock permit fee (even thoughwe do not yet have a boat dock), and will continue to do so. Putting a boat dock on anempty lot now is ludicrous. We don\\'t live close so we couldn\\'t maintain it or monitor it,etc. In addition, when we purchased the lot we paid a 5-figure premium just for thispermit.We love boating.We played by the rules. It would be unfair for the BOR tochange the rules for dubious reasons to prevent us from putting in a dock when we build.Congress has mandated that it is a Federal responsibility to provide opportunities forpublic recreation at Federal water projects. Only 10% of Lake Cascade is zoned forprivate recreational usage. Eliminating or reducing private boat docks, forcing boaters touse public marinas wouldreduceopportunitiesforrecreation.The new proposed rules are too heavy handed regarding termination of lapsed dockpermits.Allowing the BOR to terminate without recourse a permit for lack of payment istoo harsh. Local BOR offices need discretionary authority to reinstate lapsed permits ifcircumstances warrant.Thank you for reading our comments.Si\\\\Peter E. Jense6\\'Victoria I-I. Jensen',\n",

Box25007Denver, CO 80225-0007Dear Mr. Rizzi,This letter provides comments to potential changes in 43 CFR part 429, which willimpact cabin site leases on Nelson Reservoir. I am writing to protest the proposedchange since the BOR would no longer allowing cabin site lessees to build additionalstructures, or possibly even improve existing structures, on their sites.Three years ago my wife and I purchased a cabin on site #105 on Nelson Reservoir inPhillips County, Montana.We have put a great deal of work and money into cleaning upand improving the site and the structures on it. Currently there are only 2 structures onthis site - a cabin and an outhouse. My fi.jture plans are to build a small shed on this siteto keep equipment in.Many, if not most, cabin sites on Nelson Reservoir already havesheds or boathouses so this is something the BOR has always allowed in the past,providing a permit was obtained first.The rational for making this change is that building additional structures on a site resultsin more private exclusive use of BOR land. I disagree with this assessment since mylease already gives me exclusive use of this site, which is only 1/10 of an acre. Thus, anyfuture structures built on this site would not result in any additional exclusion to thegeneral public than currently exists.Also a small shed built on 1/10 of an acre, next to 2existing structures, would have no impact to public recreational opportunities on Nelsonreservoir.Land management changes being considered by the BOR would bring a great deal ofuncertainty concerning our site lease. It would be doubtfull whether I could ever makeimprovements to our cabin, build on to it, replace it with a different structure or build asmall shed to keep gear in. Our cabin has been a source of enjoyment for our friends andfamily and we have spent many weekends at our cabin site fishing, boating, swimmingand enjoying the solitude.We have also put a great deal of time and money (we are amiddle-income family) into improving our cabin, and the site, and I have hopes ofkeeping this cabin in our family for many years to come and would like to pass it on toour children so they can continue to enjoy it in the future.Nelson reservoir is a tremendous resource to northeast Montana and provides manyrecreational opportunities.This in turn provides many economic benefits to the localbusinesses in Malta, Glasgow and Saco.Although the cabin sites take up a smallpercentage of the lakeshore, the vast majority of the recreational activity along the lakeoccurs at these cabin sites by the lessees, friends and family.At the same time thegeneral public has excellent access to the lake along the majority of the lakeshore, at acampground, which is seldom if ever full, and at two boat landings. Public access to thelake and around Nelson Reservoir has never been an issue or a concern and most of thelakeshore is undeveloped and gets very little or no use.For these reasons I urge theBORto not make the proposed changes which would preventcabin site lessees from improving or building structures on sites and I urge the BOR tocontinue to allow lessees the opportunity to build additional structures within their sitelease and be allowed to make improvements to their cabins.Cabin site leases shouldalso be a minimum of 20-years with a guaranteed renewal so lessees are able to makeimprovements on sites and structures without fear that time and money invested at thesesites would go to waste.Thank you for the opportunity to comment.Sincerely,Mark G.

Reference: Subpart H - 429.31 (b) Reclamation prohibits any use that wouldresult in \"new\" private exclusive recreational or residential use of Reclamation land, facilities, orwaterbodies.At the meeting, we were told the interpretation of this rule was that work within the existing \"footprint\" ofthe existing buildings on the site was allowed. But, if we wanted to expand the \"footprint\" by enlargingthe existing cabin or add a storage shed, this would be considered \"new\" private exclusive use andwould not be allowed.When further interpretation was asked; the response was directed to our areamanagers in Billings; who indicated they would review the applications on a case by case basis.Itwould be helpful for those of us who have existing permit and who might want to improve our cabinsor request an additional shed on the site; have the BOR clearly define their interpretation between\"new\" and \"existina\" uses in the Federal Reaister.By adding additional structures or enlarging ones existing on an already in-use site would not result in\"new\" private exclusive use of BOR land. Most sites on Nelson Reservoir are on approx .10 of an acreand enlarging or adding additional structures would have absolutely no impact to public recreationalopportunities at Nelson Reservoir.Iwould like to request, the proposed wording in the next Federal Register Subpart H 429.31 (b) read:\"Reclamation prohibits any use that would result in new private exclusive recreational orresidential useoutside the already existing permitted areasof Reclamation land, facilities, orwaterbodies.\"Page 1 of 2James WoodwardP0 Box 1382Malta MT 59538-1382With this slight re-wording of the Federal Register the existing cabin-site permit holders will be providedthe opportunity to improve or enlarge their cabins or maybe put up a small shed by following theguidelines in our existing permit. Please refer to Section 11 a - k which addresses uses of existingpermit sites. This section refers to the area of land within the permit; not the structures on it.The last changes to the proposed Federal Register base on our previous letters; gives meencouragement the above request will be considered seriously. I thank the BOR for clarifying theirintent to allow the cabin sites at Nelson Reservoir the certainty of permit use for many years into thefuture so we can continue to keep the area alive and viable for our families, friends, and the publics\\'continual recreational enjoyment.We request that now you allow us to improve those sites within theguidelines of our existing permits.Additionally, I request all future information regarding our use of BOR land at Nelson Reservoircontinued to be sent to myself and all cabin-site permit holders on Nelson Reservoir as in the past.Sincerely,ames Woodward-Lot #52 Nelson ReservoirSaco, MT. 59621cc:US Senator Max BaucusUS Senator Jon TesterUS Representative Denny RehbergPage 2 of 2',\n",

Box 25007Denver, CO 80225-0007Proposed Rule Comment: BOR-2008-0004Dear Mr. Rizzi,Since you never responded to my letter of September 2007 Iam herewith sending my comments again. It seems to me thata longtime taxpayer, retired military, retired businessmanwould at least deserve a response of some sort! !!As landowners and users of Lake Cascade in central Idaho,we are sending this letter to comment on Proposed Rule1006-AA51 titled Use of Bureau of Reclamation Land,Facilities, and Waterbodies; specifically the proposedchanges to Subpart H - Prohibited andUnauthorized Uses ofReclamation Land, Facilities,and Waterbodies.Contained in this proposal, which addresses new structures,also states an intent to prohibit existing docks\"Whenauthorizations for these uses(docks)expire, Reclamationgenerally will not renew them.\"This statement is of great concern.We are not \"exclusive\" users of Lake Cascade. As you know,most all of the lakeshore is government owned, and 75% ofthe surrounding land is approved campgrounds and or wildlife areas.The landowners adjacent to the lake have beenallowed access since the reservoir was created and thedocks have always been provided by these owners.The elimination of the present docks will decrease accessto the lake by the public NOT increase access.Along with our neighbors, we relinquished an individualdock permit to apply for one permit for five families, asthe Bureau of Reclamation suggested. Our dock (PermitNumber 67) is for five families and with their familiesconstitutes fifty members and we constantly have others,many that we have never met, who routinely use the dock.We have never denied access to anyone who happens by andwants to use the dock. Do you actually think that byremoving this dock you will increase access to this body ofwater?Another factor you should consider is the economic impact.Have you conducted an economic impact study to determinehow many families will sell their property and leave thearea if their use of the body of water upon which they havebuilt their dream vacation property is restricted by yourproposed rule to take their docks?Also, is this a \"Government \"Taking\" of personal propertyand subject to reimbursement to the owners for the \"Taking\"of their dock? Has an attorney reviewed your taking ofthese docks? How will the docks be valued? Where will fundsfor reimbursement come from?How about the environmental impact of removing all thosedocks?What will the impact be on the fish that use thedocks for shelter from the sun in this shallow reservoirand as a place to rest? Structures such as these aredesirable fish habitat and actively sought as fish habitatstructures by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game topromote fish reproduction in this reservoir.TheLakeCascadeResourceManagement Plan issued by yourbureau is the proper place to address issues such as thisand not by a proposed rule change to address a problem areain another state.These issues are best addressedseparately in their respective locales rather than by broadrule changes that paint all with the same brush. Your localpeople are intelligent, articulate individuals who have thebest interests of all Idahoans, as well as all others whomay visit the area to vacation, in mind as they set policyand make determinations affecting how the reservoir isused. Allow them to use their Resource Management Plan as atool to resolve issues such as docks and other accessissues. Public hearing input, relative data and otherfactors relating to these issues is published in their planand made available to all who are interested. Please givethis already existing communication channel an opportunityto address this issue.We landowners around the reservoir are the bureau\\'s bestresource in all reality. We have the financial resourcesand many of us retirees also have the time, to accomplish alot of positive things for Lake Cascade if we are not beatover the head with a thoughtless rule change. In ournorthern portion of the lake we have contributed manythousands of dollars to build the North Lake RecreationalSewer and Water District. This self-approved district hassignificantly cleaned up the water in Lake Cascade. Wehomeowners at Lake Cascade sued a community up-streamthereby forcing them to clean up it\\'s effluent from theirtreatment plant and in turn cleaned up Lake Cascade. Wehomeowners paid to have a dirt road (which was oiledannually to reduce dust) adjacent to Lake Cascade paved,thereby eliminating contaminated runoff from entering thelake. All these actions contribute to the health of thelake.As you can see we do not just sit around on our docksrunning off strangers. We can be your best resource if youinclude us in your deliberations and treat us fairly as weall have the best interests of Lake Cascade in mind.P.S. Your latest attempt at revised regulations appear veryheavy handed; ie: no transfer of permits, penalties andfines, prohibiting new docks, no renewal notices, excessivefees for docks-many of which are used only 1 or 2 months ayear.Looks like something ole PUTIN would write for thegood people of Georgia.RespectfulBarbara Ann PutnamCc:Mr. Bill McDonaldNW Area ManagerBoise, ID',\n",

       "  'August 18, 2008Mr. Richard Rizzi, 84-53000Bureau of Reclamation, Denver Federal CenterP.O. Box 25007Denver, CO 80225-0007Re: Proposed Rule 1006-AA51Dear Mr. RizziI have just finished reading the latest communication from Jerrold D. Gregg regarding the proposed draftrevision of Rule 43 CFR 429. I have several comments:The first is on the limit of 20 years. Why is there a time limit at all if the overall intent is not the eventualelimination of private docks from Lake Cascade? The intent of the bureau has not changed, just theapproach to accomplishing the ultimate goal of removing all private docks. What is special about twentyyears other than it seems like a long time from now. To my grandchildren it is right around the corner.One of the reasons the Lake Cascade Reservoir was but was with an expressed purpose of providing thepublic \"designated use\" recreational opportunities. There was no time limit set on this designated use.Now the BOR wants to set a 20 year or shorter (see below) expiration date for that designated use. Isthe public going to be any less interested in using Cascade 20 years from now? I think not.The criteria for renewal of permits appears to be completely arbitrarily based on what the BOR choosesto define as \"Compatibility with public needs\". What I read is that there will be a five year extension atthis time and then having agreed to this rule with the potential promise of 20 years (see above), thepermit holders will be subject to whatever the BOR determines it wants to do in 5 years. I refer to the2002 rule that prohibits new boat dock. I quote \"Through the public process it was agreed that no newboat docks permits would be issued a Lake Cascade.\" This makes it sound like the property ownersvoluntarily agreed to this rule change and now they have to live by it because a process was followed.This is not correct. The reality is that existing property owners were not strong enough to overcome theBOR power to implement this rule. It was the first step of \"boiling the frog\" by heating the water just alittle bit at a time. No new dock permits reduces the number of participants in the process. Subtract ahundred more in 5 years for noncompliance to the arbitrary rules \"we all agreed to\" in 2008 and thepool of people to protest is a lot smaller. In 10 years the end is in sight and in 20 it is game over and theBOR has what it wanted all along, no private dock on Cascade.Most of the answers to the other questions such as transfer of ownership and movingdocksfrom onelocation to another are a mute point considering the end result is no docks in the long run. This is just adiversionary tactic that makes it appear the BOR is giving something and actually trying to manage theresource at Cascade while the end result is the same, no private docks.My second comment is about the fee structure. I understand the permits need to cover the cost ofadministrating the program. That is easy for the BOR to calculate and report by project, f they so choose.It is clear that by not releasing information even under the Freedom Of Information Act that the feesnow and soon to be charged have no relevance to the Cascade project. Otherwise this informationwould be made public. What I find most troubling is the reference to \"User fees will be based on\"market price...\". This is not a fee, IT IS A TAX! These are not commercial facilities we are talking about.They are private docks used for non commercial purposes. Now the BOR wants to reap additionalincome by collecting a PROPERTY TAX for the privilege of floating a dock on the reservoir. Again thepurpose of this is to gradually wear down the number of owners willing to pay this TAX and reduce theresistance to removing all the dock from Cascade.The question no one seems to be addressing is why the BOR set on removing docks when most of theproperty owners that own them support the BOR though the fees they already pay. In addition most ofthe permit holders have made significant improvements to the lake frontage that is limiting the erosionand sedimentation around Cascade. I agree there needs to be management of the docks as some arenot safe and need to be removed but that can certainly be done without removing all docks. Theenjoyment of the public is not impacted by the relatively few private docks on Cascade. I also raise thequestion of how the Tamarack Marina fits in this plan. Is it to disappear in 20 years? I think not. Againthe response to this question has been, \"Public hearing were held and we are required to follow therules\", just as the BOR will be required to remove private docks in 20 years.Itake pride in being an American, a rational American that it not ultra left or ultra right.Ihave faith ingovernment as a whole but I can say with certainty the current actions by the BOR are what peoplearound the world are trying to flee from. This heavy handed, we are going take it away either now, or in5 years or in 20 attitude is un American and gives government a bad name. The BOR is attacking ourfreedom to own property and use public resources in a responsible manner. Instead of focusing onmanaging water resources for the good of the people the BOR is systematically and arbitrarily takingthat freedom from every private land owner on Cascade.cc Honorable Mike Crapo,,,^\\'onorable Dick Kempthrornecc Honorable Larry Craigcc Honorable Bill SaIlcc Honorable Mike Simpsoncc Honorable Butch Ottercc Honorable Leland Heinrichcc Honorable Ken Robertscc Honorable Paul Shepherdcc Mr. Robert Meinencc Mr. Rick Browncc Mr. Garth Taylorcc Ms. Theresa Perrycc Valley County Board of County Commissionerscc Honorable Dick Cartercc Honorable Brad Backuscc Honorable Bert Kulesza',\n",

This element would continue exclusive use \\n\\nof federal land - beyond the expiration of existing \\nconcession contracts - by the interim relocation \\nof privately owned trailers.  Such action is cont\\nrary to the purpose of the project and in conflict \\nwith governing federal statutes and binding agency policy.   \\n The preferred alternative in the Draft EIS called for the permanent removal of all private \\ntrailers - ﬁ[t]his alternative would permanently remo\\nve all private long-term exclusive-use trailer sites and provide increased and improved short-\\nterm use opportunities.ﬂ  DEIS p. 41.\\n  The FEIS includes an identical sentence, but immediately follows it with the contradictory proposal for \\n\\ninterim relocation rather than removal of the trailers.  FEIS p. 43.   \\n Governing statutory authority mandates that the Department of the Interior and \\nReclamation provide for public recreation.  To the same effect, binding Reclamation policy \\nimplementing that mandate prohibits exclusive use of the federal estate and requires that \\nexisting exclusive use be eliminated at the ear\\nliest opportunity.   The proposal for interim \\nrelocation of private trailers at Lake Berryessa conflicts with both the law and the agency™s \\nimplementing policy.     \\nWe attach a legal opinion (Opinion) from David Nawi, the former Regional Solicitor for \\nthe Pacific Southwest Region of the U.S. Department of the Interior from 1993 to 2001, and now \\n\\nOf Counsel to Shute, Mihaly & Weinberger, LLP.   This opinion concludes:   ﬁReclamation may \\nnot provide for interim relocation of and exclusiv\\ne use by trailers at Lake Berryessa beyond the \\nexpiration of existing concession contracts.  Su\\nch action would conflict with governing statutory \\nauthority and violate binding Reclamation policy.  The expenditure of federal funds in furtherance \\n\\nof such action would be unauthorized.ﬂ  Opinion, p. 1.  \\n The purpose of the Lake Berryessa planning document\\n is ﬁto remedy over four decades \\nof management practice under which prime re\\ncreational areas have been reserved for long-term \\ntrailer site permittees, to the exclusion of the majority of visitors to Lake Berryessa.

The proposal to continue exclusive use would directly prevent \\nachievement of that purpose.   \\n Prior to its release Reclamation officials characterized the FEIS as a ﬁbalancedﬂ \\ndecision.

We appreciate the need and \\nsupport Reclamation™s efforts to balance legitimat\\ne but competing recreational interests.     \\nHowever, we cannot support a proposal that seeks to inject into the balance equation a use that \\n\\nis antithetical to the public™s interest and contrary to the law.   \\n The proposal to continue exclusive use \\nat Lake Berryessa makes Reclamation \\nvulnerable to a legal challenge.  A successful \\nchallenge would have far-reaching consequences for all Reclamation projects and potentially for any federal agency that manages public land.   \\n With public concern already focused on privatization issues related to federal land, \\nattempts by Reclamation to defend a proposal to\\n develop new private vacation sites will only \\nserve to exacerbate those concerns.   What™s\\n more, acting in disregard of its own policies and \\ncongressional mandates will diminish the public™s \\nconfidence in Reclamation and its policies.  \\n  Reclamation has put substantial resources into this project.  The agency™s proposals to \\neliminate exclusive use have received wides\\npread and enthusiastic support from local \\ngovernments, individuals, and recreation and cons\\nervation organizations that stand ready to \\nsupport a record of decision that accomplishes this goal.

Reclamation has \\nsuggested such interim relocation as a potential\\n mitigation measure in the Final Environmental \\nImpact Statement (FEIS) for the Visitors \\nServices Plan (VSP) for Lake Berryessa.  SUMMARY OF CONCLUSION  It is our opinion Reclamation may not provide \\nfor interim relocation of and exclusive use \\nby trailers at Lake Berryessa beyond the expiration of existing concession contracts.  Such action \\nwould conflict with governing statutory authority and violate binding Reclamation policy.  The \\nexpenditure of federal funds in furtherance of such action would be unauthorized.    BACKGROUND  We briefly describe the background and setting in which the question at issue arises.    In October, 2003, Reclamation issued a Draft \\nEnvironmental Impact Statement (DEIS) in \\nconnection with its proposal to adopt a VSP for Lake Berryessa.  In the Purpose and Need \\nsection, the DEIS states, ﬁThe project is needed \\nto correct four decades of resort operation under which prime recreational areas have been reserved\\n for long-term trailer site permittees, to the \\nexclusion of the majority of vis\\nitors to Lake Berryessa.  Such practice is in conflict with modern \\nReclamation policies regulating exclusive use \\nof public property.ﬂ  DEIS, p. 33.  The DEIS Elisabeth Frater  April 3, 2006 \\n\\nPage 2 identified Alternative B as the Preferred Action.  Under this alternative, ﬁ[a]ll long-term trailers would be removed from the resort areas. . . .ﬂ  DEIS, p. 3.  In October 2005, Reclamation issued the FEIS for the VSP.   Relevant to the issue at hand, the FEIS raised, for the first time, the pot\\nential of interim relocation of the trailers: \\n The Preferred Alternative would \\npermanently remove all private \\nlong-term exclusive-use trailer si\\ntes and provide increased short-term use opportunities.  However, potential mitigation measures \\n\\ncould include a phase out period that could involve relocation or consolidation of trailers on an interim basis to a less intrusive, fully \\n\\ndeveloped site; action that could require additional environmental analysis.\\n1    \\nFEIS, p. 1; see pp. 17, 43, 170 for virtually identical statements regarding \\ntrailer relocation.  The FEIS includes a new impact of Altern\\native B (the Preferred Alternative) not identified in the DEIS.  Impact 3.9.2.52 in the FEIS states: \\n Exclusive long-term trailer si\\ntes on the lakeshore would be terminated and trailer owners w\\nould be required to vacate under \\nAlternative B.  These effects would be expected to be moderate to \\nminor.  Potential mitigation measures could include a phase out \\n\\nperiod that could involve relocation or consolidation of trailers on an interim basis to a less intrusive, fully developed site; actions \\n\\nthat could require additional environmental analysis. The impacts \\n\\nwould be relatively short-term in \\nthe sense that the loss of trailer \\npermittees eventually would be compensated by gains in other \\n\\nareas, but long-term in the sense \\nthat removal of\\n the long-term \\ntrailer opportunities would be permanent.  \\n \\nFEIS, p. 170. \\n The above-cited statement connects the suggested\\n mitigation of interi\\nm trailer relocation \\nto the effect stated, i.e., lease \\ntermination and a requirement that \\nthe trailer owners vacate, and it appears to be the only such statement in the FE\\nIS.  The statement brings\\n us to the issue of Reclamation\\n=s authority to continue exclusive use by relocated trailer owners beyond the expiration of existing concession contracts. \\n                                                           \\n 1 We base our analysis on the understanding that the relocation/consolidation would extend beyond the term of the \\nexisting concession contracts and wo\\nuld take place on project lands.   \\n2 The DEIS identifies Impact 3.9-2 as Potential Impact to Population. \\nElisabeth Frater  April 3, 2006 \\n\\nPage 3 ANALYSIS \\n \\n1. Statutory Provisions Mandate that Reclam\\nation Provide Recreational Opportunities \\nto the General Public, a Mandate Anti\\nthetical to Exclusive Private Use. \\n Congress established the federal reclamation \\nprogram in 1902 to open up the arid West to \\nirrigated farming and the accompanying economic development.  See\\n Reclamation Act of 1902, \\n43 U.S.C. §§ 371-616 (1902).  The overriding goal of the reclamation program was to foster the \\ncreation of small, family-sized farms in \\nareas irrigated by federal projects.  See United States v. Tulare Lake Canal Co., 535 F.2d 1093, 1119-20 (9th Cir. 1976).    In 1965, the Federal Water Project Recreation \\nAct added a recreational element to these \\noriginal purposes.  16 U.S.C. §§ 460l-12.  The Act authorized the Secretary of the Interior, in conjunction to the construction or control of any reservoir,   \\n  to investigate, plan, construct, operate and maintain, or otherwise \\nprovide for public outdoor recreation\\n and fish and wildlife enhancement facilities, to acquire\\n or otherwise make available \\nsuch adjacent lands or interests therein as are necessary for public \\noutdoor recreation or fish and wildlife use, and to provide for public use and enjoyment of project lands, facilities, and water areas in a manner coordinated with the other project purposes.  \\n16 U.S.C. §§ 460l-18(a); emphasis added.  The Secr\\netary was authorized, in particular, to enter into agreements with federal, state and local \\nagencies to ﬁbest promote the development and \\noperation of such lands or facilities in the public interest for recreation and fish and wildlife enhancement purposes.ﬂ  16 U.S.C. §§ 460l-18(b); emphasis added.  \\n\\n Congress reiterated the importance of the public recreational purposes when it enacted the Reclamation Development Act of 1974.  Title \\nVI of this Act was devoted to the Solano \\nProject Recreational Facilities.  It provides:  \\n\\n In order to provide for the protection, use, and enjoyment of the \\naesthetic and recreational values in\\nherent in the Federal lands and waters at Lake Berryessa . . . the Secretary of the In\\nterior is . . . authorized to develop, operate, and maintain such \\nshort-term \\nrecreation facilities as he deems necessary for the safety, health, \\nprotection and outdoor recreational use of the visiting public\\n . . . and to otherwise administer th\\ne Federal land and water areas associated with said Lake Berryessa in such manner that, in his \\n\\nopinion, will best provide for the public recreational use and enjoyment thereof. . . .   Public Law 93-493; emphasis added.  \\n Elisabeth Frater  April 3, 2006 \\n\\nPage 4 Further, in the Reclamation Recreati\\non Management Act of 1992, Congress found: \\nﬁThere is a Federal responsibility to provide opportunities for public recreation at Federal water projects,ﬂ and it amended prior reclamation laws \\nto provide for increased federal authority ﬁto \\nexpand existing recreation facilities to meet \\npublic demand.ﬂ  16 U.S.C. §§ 460l-31; emphasis added.  \\nAs shown in the italicized language, the statutes set out above consistently make clear \\nthat recreational use of project lands is to be short term and mu\\nst benefit the public.  Exclusive private use is in direct conflict with the ma\\nndate for public benefit through short term use.\\n3  Reclamation has recognized this conflict, and \\nas set out immediately \\nbelow, the Reclamation \\nManual directs that it be eliminated without delay. \\n 2. Reclamation Manual Provisions Mandate \\nthe Termination of Exclusive Use. \\n Reports prepared by the Government Account\\nability Office (GAO, fo\\nrmerly the General \\nAccounting Office) and the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior from as early as \\n1972 have addressed Reclamation™s \\nsignificant shortcomings in pr\\noviding public access at Lake Berryessa and other sites.4  In response to these reports, and in order to bring the management of \\nLake Berryessa into compliance with statut\\nory requirements for th\\ne provision of public recreation, Reclamation adopted binding policie\\ns in the Reclamation Manual specifically \\nprohibiting exclusive private use.  \\nThe provisions of the Reclamation Manual ar\\ne mandatory and must be followed.  The \\nReclamation Manual contains the following clea\\nr and unambiguous statement on the very first \\npage of the Manual on Reclamation\\n=s website:  ﬁThe Reclama\\ntion Manual (RM) describes mandatory requirements\\n for Reclamation-wide programs.ﬂ  See\\n http://www.usbr.gov/recman/index.html\\n (boldface added).5      Reclamation Manual Policy LND PO4 sets\\n out the congressional finding in the Reclamation Recreation Management Act of 1992 th\\nat ﬁ[t]here is a Federal responsibility to \\nprovide opportunities for public recreation at Federal water projects.ﬂ  16 U.S.C. §§ 4601-31.  Consistent with this clear expression of congressional intent, Policy LND PO4 states:                                                            \\n 3 The fact that trailer consolidation and exclusive use is described in the FEIS as mitigation does not provide \\nReclamation authority to implement the action, as NEPA do\\nes not confer additional substantive authority to federal \\nagencies.  \\nSylvester v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \\n871 F.2d 817, 822 (Ninth Cir. 1989); 42 USC § 4335; 40 CFR \\n§1500.6. \\n4 ﬁPublic Recreational Facilities Not Adequately Develo\\nped at Lake Berryessa, California.  A Bureau of \\nReclamation Projectﬂ (GAO, February 22, 1972); Memorandum\\n Audit Report to Assistant Secretary for Water and \\nScience from Acting Assistant Inspector General for Audits (May 17, 1995); Audit Report on Concessions Managed \\nby the Bureau of Reclamation (May 2000). \\n5 In addition, we have found two federal district court d\\necisions that cite the Reclamation Manual.  Whiffen v. Cole\\n, 264 F. 252 (D. Idaho 1919); Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation v. McDonald\\n, 2003 WL \\n1955763 (E.D. Wash. 2003). \\nElisabeth Frater  April 3, 2006 \\n\\nPage 5 Reclamation will guided by the following principles:  \\n \\n*   *   * \\nI.  Prohibit new exclusive uses and eliminate existing exclusive \\n\\nuses, as allowed by current use agreements, to maximize public \\nrecreation opportunities, facilities, and services.  Additional provisions of the Reclamation Ma\\nnual provide more \\ndetail regarding the \\noverarching policy guidance in LND PO4.  Policy LND PO2, addressing Concessions Management, states: ﬁExclusive use of the Fede\\nral estate will not be allowed and existing exclusive use will be removed as soon \\nas possible.ﬂ  Policy LND PO2, 3.F. \\n  A further level of specificity is provi\\nded by Reclamation Manual, Directives and \\nStandards LND 04-01, Concessions Manageme\\nnt by Reclamation.  LND 04-01, defines \\nﬁexclusive useﬂ as ﬁany use that excludes other a\\nppropriate public recreation use or users for extended periods of time,ﬂ includ\\ning boat docks, cabins, trailers, and manufactured or mobile \\nhomes.  Directives a\\nnd Standards LND 04-01, 1.C.\\n  Under the heading Commercial Services \\nPlan, LND 04-01 states: ﬁFacilities\\n, services, or sites considered to be exclusive use will not be allowed and should not be considered as a part of any commercial services\\n planning alternative.  Existing exclusive use facilities, \\nservices, and sites must be rem\\noved when a contract expires or, \\nif possible, sooner.ﬂ  Id., 3.B.6.  Finally, LND 04-01 provides: \\n Existing concession contracts mu\\nst be brought into compliance \\nwith the Concessions Management\\n Policy and Directives at the first legal opportunity, for example, \\nif the contract is amended.  If a \\nconcession contract expires or is terminated . . . any subsequent \\nconcession contract must comply \\nwith the Concessions Policy and Directives and Standards.  Id., 2.A.6  \\nWe have set out the above provisions of the Reclamation Manual at length to demonstrate \\nthe clear and consistent directi\\non they provide, that exclusive use must be terminated at the \\nearliest time.  Exclusive use is antithetical to\\n public use and hence contrary to the clearly expressed congressional mandate that public\\n recreational use must be provided.    3. Reclamation Environmental Documents \\nSupport Termination of Exclusive Use.  The Draft and Final Environmental Impact \\nStatements prepared by Reclamation in \\nconnection with the VSP project acknowledge that exclusive use of public lands at Lake                                                           \\n 6 LND 04-01 addresses Unusual Circumstances that would prevent Reclamation from issuing a new contract in a \\ntimely manner.  LND 04-01, 2.B.  This provision does not affect the issue before us. \\nElisabeth Frater  April 3, 2006 \\n\\nPage 6 Berryessa is contrary to Reclamation™s policies.  As quoted above, the DEIS explains that the project is needed ﬁto correct over four d\\necades of resort operations under which prime \\nrecreational areas have been reserved for long-te\\nrm trailer permittees, to the exclusion of the \\nmajority of the visitors to Lake Berryessa.  Such\\n practice is in conflict with modern Reclamation \\npolicies regulating exclusive use of public property.ﬂ  DEIS, p. 33.  Similarly, the FEIS states \\nthat ﬁthe existing situation that has resulted in large areas of prime federal property being \\nmanaged for exclusive long-term users is not co\\nmpatible with appropriate use of limited public \\nrecreation lands and water but more akin to pr\\nivate land use.ﬂ  FEIS, Response to Comments, pp. \\n19-74.  \\n 4. The Expenditure of Appropriated Funds for Continued Exclusive Use is Not \\nAuthorized.\\n7   A federal agency is a creature of the law and can function only to the extent authorized by law.  E.g., Atlantic City Electric Co. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Comm=n, 295 F.3d 1, 8 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  The Supreme Court has expresse\\nd the essential principle in appropriations law as follows:  ﬁThe established rule is that the expenditure of public funds is proper only when authorized by Congress, not that public funds may be expended unless prohibited by Congress.ﬂ  \\nUnited States v. MacCollom, 426 U.S. 317, 321 (1976).  Whether a\\nppropriated funds are legally available depends on the satisfaction of three criteria: (1) the purpose \\nof the obligation or expenditure must be authorized; (2) the obligation must occur with\\nin the time limits applicable to \\nthe appropriation; and (3) the obligation and expenditure must \\nbe within the amounts Congress \\nhas established.  See GAO, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law (ﬁRed Bookﬂ),8 Volume I \\nat 4-6 (3d ed. 2004).  \\n Regarding authorization of an expenditure, the Comptroller General has stated:  ﬁIt is a \\nwell-settled rule of statutory construction that where an appropriation is made for a particular object, by implication it confers authority to incur expenses which are necessary or proper or incident to the proper execution of the object.ﬂ  6 Comp. Ge\\nn. 619, 621 (1927).  The standard GAO applies in considering agency authority is summarized as follows:  ﬁ[T]he question is \\nwhether the expenditure falls within the agency\\n=s legitimate range of discretion, or whether its \\nrelationship to an authorized purpose or function is so attenuated as to take it beyond that range.ﬂ  Id. at 4-24, citing Opinion B-223608, Dec. 19, 1988.    \\nRegarding the issue before us, the governing st\\natutes mandate the provision of public use, \\nwhich is antithetical to continued exclusive private use.  Consistent with Congressional direction, Reclamation has adopted and included in the Reclamation Manual a mandatory prohibition on \\ncontinued or new exclusive private use of water project lands.  Reclamation has thus already exercised whatever discretion it may have under the rele\\nvant statutes in regard to this issue.  We \\nare of the opinion that the governing statutes and the mandatory\\n provisions of the Reclamation \\n                                                          \\n 7 Our analysis is based on appropriations authorized to carry the purposes of the statutes set out above governing the \\nSolano Project and othe\\nr Reclamation projects. \\n8 The GAO Red Book is the federal government™s authoritative source regarding the use of appropriated funds. \\nElisabeth Frater  April 3, 2006 \\n\\nPage 7 Manual set out above would compel the conclusi\\non that any expenditure of funds to further private exclusive use would not fall within Recl\\namation™s ﬁlegitimate range of discretionﬂ and \\ntherefore would not be authorized.  CONCLUSION \\n Statutes governing the operation of Reclamation projects genera\\nlly and specifically of the Solano Project direct that provision be made for recreational \\nuse and enjoyment by the public.  \\nExclusive private use is in direct conflict with th\\nis direction to provide public use.  Consistent with the legislative direction, binding provisions of the Reclamation Manual direct that exclusive \\nuse be terminated as early as \\nlegally possible, and that no new or amended concession contracts \\nallow such exclusive private use.  Based on thes\\ne clear and controlling authorities, it is our opinion that Reclamation may not \\nauthorize exclusive use by trailers at Lake Berryessa beyond the expiration of existing concession contracts.  In addition, any expenditures incurred to further such relocation would not be authorized under appropriations law, since they would conflict with statutory authorization and binding provisions of the Reclamation Manual implementing such \\nauthorization.

Box 25007Denver, CO 80225-0007Attn: Richard Rizzi, Mail Code: 84-53000RE: Proposed Rule1006-AA51Dear Mr. Rizzi:I am writing in regard to this revised rule, which continues to be insufficient in its methodology to\"manage\" the docks on Lake Cascade. Why does Reclamation continue to lump docks in the same classof assets as cabins and mobile homes? It would seem more prudent to approach docks, moorings andramps similar to how other Federal agencies are approaching them, i.e., as a lesser form of private use.On Lake Cascade where there is only a narrow strip of Reclamation land separating the private landowners from the high water mark, this definition of \"private exclusive\" makes no sense. When mobilehomes and cabins are physically located on Reclamation land, they should be \"managed\" differentlythan docks; specifically, as a \"lesser form\".The one-size-fits-all approach that Reclamation is taking with this rule would be better served allowingthe Regional Directors deal with these locally-unique issues. In trying to \"fix\" an issue with mobilehomes on Reclamation land in California, Reclamation has negatively impacted recreation opportunitieson Lake Cascade Idaho.In the proposed rule, Section 429.2 Definitions, Reclamation defines \"private exclusive recreational orresidential use\" and lumps cabins in with docks, for the same level of management by Reclamation.Again, this seems to be a rather heavy-handed approach to manage docks and dock access, versusmanaging cabins and roads which physically reside on Reclamation land.Please remove docks from this definition as \"private use\". Or at a minimum utilize the concept of otherFederal agencies which define docks as a \"lesser form\" of private use.Thank you and I look forward to a much more recreation-friendly rule.Ji:r7:/o79412815 Hereford RóDonnelly, ID 83615CC: Sen.

Box 25007Denver, Colorado 80225-0007Attn: Mr. Richard RizziMail Code: 84-53000Subject:Comment letter in response to notice of proposed rulemaking for Rule1006-AA51, 43 C.F.R. Part 429Dear Mr. Rizzi:Iwrite to you in opposition to the proposed rule to eliminate private docks onBureau of Reclamation (\"BOR\") lakes. On July 18, 2008, the BOR published anotice of proposed rule making to revise 43 C.F.R. Part 429. The proposed rule,entitled Use of Bureau ofReclamation Land, Facilities, and Waterbodies,as writtenwould lead to the gradual elimination of private dock ownership on BOR lakes,including Lake Cascade, a beautiful lake in the center of Idaho.The proposed rule is heavy-handed and should be withdrawn. The proposedrule would have serious consequences for Idahoans who have long enjoyed the rightto recreate on Lake Cascade and would impose arbitrary restrictions that wouldadversely affect the environment, the elderly, tourism, the local economy, andIdahoans\\' quality of life.We in Idaho know all too well the consequences of federal agencies orpoliticians imposing their will on Idahoans without regard for local impact. Twothirds of Idaho is controlled by federal agencies. The BOR\\'s proposed rule continuesthe trend of Washington, D.C. mandates with little regard for local consequences. Ifimposed, federal bureaucrats thousands of miles away would be able to makeextensive decisions about local issues without ever consulting with people here inIdaho.For example, the rule would give the BOR \"unilateral\" authority to terminatedock permits on Lake Cascade at any point and without giving the public a chanceto comment. The rule leaves a permit holder with little opportunity to redressgrievances or correct errors and, in some cases, to even be told the facts upon whicha remote bureaucrat has decided that the permit holder should lose his or her dock.Local elected officials are excluded from the process entirely. Additionally the ruleleaves to federal bureaucrats sweeping authority to declare docks \"incompatible\"and force their removal for some yet-to-be determined \"higher public use.\" The rulealso sets up a situation where management conditions elsewhere would dictatepolicy decisions in Idaho. That is because national BOR officials would be decidingpolicies, bypassing regional offices which have greater understanding of what ishappening here in Idaho.There are other very troubling provisions contained within the proposed rule.The restriction on the transfer of dock permits unless the BOR gives itsdiscretionary permission is unnecessary and without clear purpose. The potentialpenalty of up to six months in prison as well as retroactive fines for those whosepermits have lapsed or been denied seems unbelievably excessive. The rule putsprohibitions in place on new docks, which disregards Congressional mandates forthe BOR to provide recreation opportunities.I appreciate the fact that the BOR took a second look at this proposed rule. Itis an improvement over the previous version. It still falls far short expectations ofIdahoans. I ask that you withdraw this proposal and work with Idahoans to createa new proposed rule that emphasizes the importance of local decision-making, isclear and concise, and gives dock owners and recreationalists assurances that theywill be able to have opportunities to enjoy Lake Cascade forever.In an effort to be of help, I have reviewed the proposed rule in detail and offersome edits to improve the rule. These edits appear in the attached, marked-upversion of the rule. Section by section, you can see where the rule falls short andneeds to be improved. In the mark-up, deleted text appears crossed out and in redand added text appears underlined and in green. (I recognize that this documentmay later be copied or transmitted in black-and-white. If so, deleted text willappear crossed out and in half-tone and added text will appear underlined and inquartertone.) Please feel to contact me if you would like an electronic version of thismark-up -My family has owned a cabin on Lake Cascade with a dock for over ten years.We want the Lake to remain a healthy and vibrant part of Idaho. Please act toprotect what the Lake represents by withdrawing the proposed rule and giving us arevised rule that is consistent with the edits below.Peter BartonPART 429--USE OF BUREAU OF RECLAMATIONLAND, FACILITIES, ANDWATERBODIESSubpart A--Purpose, Definitions, and ApplicabilitySec.429.1 What is the purpose of this part?429.2 What definitions are used in this part?429.3 What types of uses are subject to the requirements and processes establishedunder this part?429.4 What types of uses are not subject to the requirements and processesestablished under this part?429.5 Who is authorized to issue use authorizations under this part?429.6 When must water user organizations also approve use authorizations?Subpart B--Proposed Uses Involving Reclamation Easements429.7 Can I use land where Reclamation holds an easement?429.8 Is there a fee for uses involving a Reclamation easement?Subpart C--Requesting Authorization to Use Reclamation Land, Facilities, andWaterbodies429.9 What should I do before filing an application?429.10 What application form should I use?429.11Where can I get the application forms?429.12 Where do I file my application?429.13 How long will the application review process take?429.14 What criteria will Reclamation consider when reviewing applications?429.15 Is Reclamation required to issue a use authorization?Subpart D--Application Fees and Administrative Costs429.16 How much is the application fee and when should it be paid?429.17When will Reclamation collect administrative costs?429.18When do I have to pay the administrative costs?429.19What happens if the initial estimate for administrative costs is insufficient?429.20 Can I get a detailed explanation of the administrative costs?429.21 If I overpay Reclamation\\'s administrative costs, ewi11 I get a refund?429.22 Can Reclamation charge me additional administrative costs after I receive ause authorization?Subpart E--Use Fees429.23 How does Reclamation determine use fees?429.24 When should I pay my use fee?429.25 How long do I have to submit my payment for the use fee and accept theoffered use authorization?Subpart F--Reductions or Waivers of Application Fees, Administrative Costs, andUse Fees429.26 When may Reclamation reduce or waive costs or fees?Subpart G--Terms and Conditions of Use Authorizations429.27What general information appears in use authorizations?429.28What terms and conditions apply to all use authorizations?429.29What other terms and conditions may be included in my use authorization?429.30 May use authorizations be transferred or assigned to others?Subpart H--Prohibited and Unauthorized Uses of Reclamation Land, Facilities, andWaterbodies429.31What uses are prohibited on Reclamation land, facilities, and waterbodies?429.32 How will Reclamation address currently authorized existing privateexclusive recreational or residential uses?429.33What are the consequences for using Reclamation land, facilities, andwaterbodies without authorization?Subpart I--Decisions and Appeals429.34 Who is the decisionmaker for Reclamation\\'s final determinations?429.35 May I appeal Reclamation\\'s final determination?429.36 May I appeal the Commissioner\\'s decision?429.37 Does interest accrue on monies owed to the United States during my appealprocess?Authority: 43 U.S.C. 373; 43 U.S.C. §.373b, 43 U.S.C. 387; 43 C.F.R.part 21; Pub.

Before such termination, the grantee should be givennotice of the proposed termination, be told the factual and legal basis for the proposed termination,and be given an opportunity to respond. Reclamation may have made a mistake or otherwise beabout to take away a use authorization, such as a private boat dock, wrongly. For example, underSection 429.28(a)(5), Reclamation could terminate a use authorization on the basis that the granteeviolated an applicable law related to the use authorization. Reclamation though may have made amistake as to the identity of the person involved and inadvertently caught up an innocent grantee.The federal government has repeated confused peoples' identities with the do-not-fly list, and therenationalsecurity is at stake; it is not hard to envision other federal agencies making similar mistakes.The grantee should have the opportunity to be heard and to rebut or offer facts of his or her own.Under Section 429.28(a)(3)(ii), Reclamation may terminate a use authorization in the event of anemergency. In such event, there may not be time to give the grantee time to be heard.The granteecan still be given an after-the-fact explanation of what has happened. Also, the termination shouldnot be permanent. When the emergency passes, the grantee should have his or her use authorizationrestored.Sincerely,Peter Barton4944 East Stemwood StreetBoise, ID 83716>>> Peter G Barton <peterbarton@givenspursley.com> 9/16/2008 11:03 PM>>>Re: 1006-AA51New private exclusive recreational and residential uses are proposed to be prohibited under Section429.31(b). Reclamation is pursuing a single rule for all its land, facilities, and waterbodies.Theproblem to be solved, however, exists at only a few places, such as Lake Berryessa and Canyon FerryReservoir. Instead, the proposed rule should be withdrawn and replaced by a revised rule that setsout a two-tier system for Reclamation land, facilities, and waterbodies. Land, facilities, andwaterbodies, that based on a list of factors, are heavily burdened might have new private exclusiverecreational and residential uses prohibited.Applying the same list of factors to waterbodies like LakeCascade, where there is little evidence of any private exclusive recreational and residential uses, wouldhave new private exclusive recreational and residential uses permitted. On Lake Cascade, if everycabin that doesn't have a boat dock were given a dock, the Lake barely be impacted. New privateexclusive recreational and residential uses should not be prohibited on lakes like Lake Cascade.Sincerely,Peter Barton4944 East Stemwood StreetBoise, ID 83716\",\n",

Box 25007Denver, CO 80225-0007Attn: Richard Rizzi, Mail Code: 84-53000RE: Proposed Rule1006-AA51Dear Mr. Rizzi:I am writing in regard to this revised rule, which continues to be insufficient in its methodology to\"manage\" the docks on Lake Cascade. Why does Reclamation continue to lump docks in the same classof uses as cabins and mobile homes? It would seem more prudent to approach docks, moorings andramps similar to how other Federal agencies are approaching them, i.e., as a lesser form of private use.On Lake Cascade where there is only a narrow strip of Reclamation land separating the private landowners from the high water mark, this definition of \"private exclusive\" makes no sense. When mobilehomes and cabins are physically located on Reclamation land, they should be \"managed\" differentlythan docks; specifically, as a \"lesser form\".The one-size-fits-all approach that Reclamation is taking with this rule would be better served allowingthe Regional Directors deal with these locally-unique issues. In trying to \"fix\" an issue with mobilehomes on Reclamation land in California, Reclamation has negatively impacted recreation opportunitieson Lake Cascade Idaho.In the proposed rule, Section 429.2 Definitions, Reclamation defines \"private exclusive recreational orresidential use\" and lumps cabins in with docks, for the same level of management by Reclamation.Again, this seems to be a rather heavy-handed approach to manage docks and dock access, versusmanaging cabins and roads which physically reside on Reclamation land.Suggested revisions to the current rule language:Redefine boatdocksandmooringsas lesserforms of private use:Lesser forms of private exclusive recreational or residential use mean any use that involves boatdocks, moorings, piers, launch ramps, fencing, signing, and landscaping.Allowlesser forms of private useaslongaslocal BOR offices don\\'t identify problems:Lesser forms of private exclusive recreational or residential use that do not interfere withauthorized project purposes, public safety concerns, violate local norms, or result in significantenvironmental affects should be allowed unless the Regional Director identifies problems in theseareas through a public participation process.Thank you and I look forward to9uch more recreation-friendly rule.7/Jim BfindstetterP4 Box 2215\\'boise, ID 8370112815 Hereford RoadDonnelly, ID 83615CC: Sen.

Please find below a couple of my majorconcerns and possible language to revise such proposed rule citation language.Unilateral BOR Termination PowersIssue Sheet43 CFR Part 429: Use of Bureau of Reclamation Land, Facilities, and WaterbodiesISSUE STA TEMENT -The proposed rule allows existing docks to stay for now.However,it also gives the BOR unilateralauthority to terminate dock permits at any future pointwithout public commentif:1.the agency determinesdocks are incompatible with authorized project purposes,2.a higher public use is identifiedby the agency,3.a grantee fails to use the dock for its intended purposeas determined by the agency,or4.a grantee fails to comply withundefined \"applicable\"laws, regulations, or ordinances.PROPOSED RULE CITATIONS -1.§429.28 (3)Reclamation may, at any time... unilaterally terminate the use authorization \\'fReclamation determines that: (i) The use has become incompatible with aut horized projectpurposes or a higher public use is identfied.2.§429.28 (4)Reclamation may, at any time... unilaterally terminate any use authorization jfReclamation determines that the grantee has failed to use the use authorization for its intendedpurpose.3.§429.28(5) Reclamation may, at any timeunilaterally terminate any use authorization f the)Recycling is the American Waygrantee fails to comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws, regulations,ordinances, or terms and conditions of any use authorization.DISCUSSION POINTS1.Agency decisions to terminate existing use rights should always be examined through a publicreview process involving individuals affected by the decision as well as their local electedleaders.2.Unilateral termination authority with respect to individual permits must include requirementstoprovide notice, statements of fact, legal basis for the decision being made, an opportunity to rebutthe facts or legal basis cited, and an opportunity to cure alleged transgressions.3.Determinations of\"incompatibility\"or a\"higher public use\"should not be left to bureaucratsthousands of miles from the affected area. Such determinations must require public comment andinvolvement from those impacted and their local elected leaders.4.Undefined terms such as \"applicable Federal, State, and local laws, regulations,ordinances...\"give unacceptable latitude in use termination decisions. Would a dock owner who inadvertentlycut down an overhanging branch attached to a tree on BOR land be in violation of anapplicableregulation which would then lead to loss of his or her dock permit?Harsh Penalties & Fines43 CFR Part 429: Use of Bureau of Reclamation Land, Facilities, and WaterbodiesISSUE STA TEMENT -Potential penalties under the proposed rule include\"imprisonment of up to 6 months,\"giving BORofficials the right to hand out jail terms to people failing to remove docks for which permits have lapsedor been denied. Fines levied can be retroactively assessed to the date of infraction, potentiallyyears before an individual is notified he or she is in violation.PROPOSED RULE CITATIONS -§429.33(a)Unauthorized use of Reclamation land, facilities, or waterbodies is a trespassagainstthe United States. You may be subject to legal action including criminal prosecution ifyouractions violate part 423 of this chapter. A criminal prosecution could result in a fineand/orimprisonment for up to 6 months in accordance with 43 USC. 373b(b,).§429.33(b)(5) Interest accrued on the use fee from the date your unauthorized use beganasspectIed in paragraph (b) (4) of this section;DISCUSSION POINTS -1.While criminal prosecution may be warranted in a very small percentage of ruleviolations, it is unlikely to be appropriate in the majority and thefore should not belisted first as a potential course of action under the rule. Changing the wording to \"otherremedies as provided by law\" would be sufficient to provide BOR with acceptablelatitude without intimating a preference for criminal proceedings.2.Interest on penalties should accrue from the date an individual is notified in writing ofany violation, eliminating the possibility that an inadvertent tree trimming several yearsback results in thousands of dollars in penalties and interest to unsuspecting homeownerswho were unaware of their violation.Should you have any questions or comments please feel free to contact me on mycell (805) 588-5899.As one of hundreds of families who are worried that the BOR will remove ourdocks, I look forward to working our a remedy whereby we will be able to continue toenjoy the lake and provide a level of safety to the boating and recreational public.SincereluglIJ.

Box 25007Denver, CO 80225-0007Dear Sir,Recently, we have received a letter from the Bureau of Reclamation explaining aproposed rule change to 43 CFR, Part 429 regarding Reclamation land use.GID's assumption is that the Bureau of Reclamation is attempting to change the waygrazing lands are permitted and the possible re-routing of revenues to the Bureau. Thiswould adversely effect GID's budget and any control that we have over the grazing feesthat we set.As you know, many of these pastures have a gravel pit. Any change to this rule willprohibit GID from excavating or crushing in these existing pits without a special usepermit even though this resource is used solely for project purposes.Lastly, there is the issue of weed control. A large amount of the grazing lease revenue isused for weed control. If the Bureau is allowed to manage these lands they will possiblyhire a private contractor which may increase the annual pasture fee.GID would like to go on record as an objector to this proposed rule change.If you have any questions, feel free to call. As always, we appreciate our strong workingrelationship.Sincerely,Bob Hardin, Manager\",\n",

       "  '   \\nSeptember 16, 2008  \\nBy Electronic Submission  \\nMr. Richard Rizzi Bureau of Reclamation Mail Code:   84-5300 Denver Federal Center P.O. Box 25007 Denver, CO 80225-0007  Re: Revised Proposed Rule on Use of Bureau of Reclamation Land, Facilities, and Waterbodies Œ Docket # 1006-AA51 / BOR-2008-0004   Dear Mr. Rizzi:       The National Marine Manufacturers Association (NMMA) is writing to comment on the Bureau of Reclamation™s revised notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to govern the use of Bureau land, facilities and waterbodies.  73 Fed. Reg. 42,236 (July 18, 2008).  This revised proposal adds needed clarity from the first NPRM announced in 2007.  72 Fed. Reg. 39,530 (July 18, 2007).  Previously, NMMA expressed our very strong concern that the first Bureau of Reclamation proposed rule would result in the closing of boating and fishing access on Bureau waterbodies as an unnecessary solution to user conflict issues. Preventing access in this manner will have real impacts on local communities including impacting the local economies of communities near Reclamation waterbodies.  Recreational boaters, marina, boat retailer, and related service providers such as grocery stores, gas stations and restaurants will all suffer dramatically from the restriction of access.  NMMA urges Reclamation to seek new ways to improve the public and public/private uses of Reclamation resources rather than focusing on limiting uses to address a few problem circumstances.   NMMA offers these additional specific comments to the revised proposed rule:   Current private uses of Bureau of Reclamation property should be allowed to continue.   Under the original proposal, Reclamation stated that it was its policy that all currently approved private recreational uses of Reclamation land, facilities and waterbodies would not be renewed when expired unless granted a waiver in some undefined circumstances.  These uses include boat houses, docks, moorings and launch ramps, as well as floating structures such as moored vessels.  This new proposal now allows for current uses to be renewed for 20 year terms and provides criteria for approval.  NMMA supports this change.  Current private uses of Bureau Bureau of Reclamation September 16, 2008 Page 2 of 3  \\nof Reclamation property should be allowed to continue.  NMMA also supports the addition of a clear process and criteria to guide users and the Bureau in granting renewals of existing uses.  NMMA urges Reclamation to add additional language to the rule that would provide it with the ability to grant extensions beyond the 90 days proposed to allow for users to make any necessary corrections for continuing an existing recreational or residential use.  See proposed 43 C.F.R. § 429.32(b) & (f).  These corrections would allow for flexibility in the event of a natural disaster, weather related delay or other extenuating circumstance that would delay a user in making any necessary changes to their improvements.    Reclamation should allow for the conversion of improvements or structures from private to public use.  NMMA strongly recommends that Reclamation not mandate the removal of any improvements in all cases where a use is no longer approved or abandoned.  Reclamation and users should not have to tear down and remove structures and improvements within 90 days of a non-renewal of a use-authorization.1  Rather, Reclamation should have the mandate and flexibility to notify local community organizations to provide them with the option of taking over an existing improvement such as a boat ramp and maintain the use subject to a new use permit that would ensure the public use of such improvements (for example in the form of open membership organization or club that charges fees to pay for the use and upkeep of a boat dock or ramp).  Such a change will meet the goal of providing for public use of Reclamation lands and waters while avoiding the waste of the removal of improvements that could be managed in an appropriate manner.     Reclamation should seek to increase public use to counter diminished private uses.     As in the previous proposed rule, this revised proposal continues to prohibit new private exclusive recreation or residential use of Bureau waterbodies, including boat houses, docks, moorings and launch ramps, as well as floating structures such as moored vessels.  In effect, this rule reflects a gradual shift away from private use of Reclamation resources to public access (via approved concessionaires).  This policy shift will have the affect of diminishing public use and access of Reclamation resources if it is not coupled with an increase in public use opportunities.  Such public use would need to be supported by a policy of aggressively seeking partners and concessionaires to manage Reclamation waterbodies.  The take over of an existing private use by an organization that would provide public access (in the form of an open membership organization whose fees pay for the upkeep of the improvements) should be encouraged by Reclamation and not be considered a prohibited new use.   * * *                                                  1 Proposed 43 C.F.R. 429.32(f)(requiring that upon non-renewal the grantee will return the property as near as possible to its original undisturbed condition or have it removed by Reclamation within 90 days of the non-renewal).   Bureau of Reclamation September 16, 2008 Page 3 of 3  NMMA is the leading national recreational marine trade association, with nearly 1,700 members involved in every aspect of the boating industry.  NMMA members manufacture over 80 percent of recreational boats, engines, trailers, accessories and gear used by boaters and anglers in the United States.  Recreational boating is a major consumer goods industry that generated $37.5 billion in sales and services during 2007.  The total economic value of recreational boating to our nation is much greater with a total direct impact value of $107.1 billion.  Boating is a popular pastime with 59.1 million adults participating in recreational boating annually.    \\nNMMA appreciates the opportunity to provide these comments.

First of all, the tune frame isn't clear enough.Ican't understand if the 20years mentioned will be the new renewal time for permits instead of the presentfive years or if it means that after that time there will be no more permits at all.The system now of the area BOR notifying the holder in writing when it istime to renew the permit works well and I feel this method should continue.Ninety days prior to the date should be the minimum and the area office shouldhave the authority to reissue permits when holders can show extenuatingcircumstances.Ifmy dock is in compliance with permit regulations, I believe I shouldhave the right to transfer my permit to my children or with the sale of my cabinand that should be covered in the new rule.Your truly,Mary Ballantyne\",\n",

I petitioned for these permits many years ago and havebeen paying the dock permit fees for them ever since.I am cautiously optimistic that the \"voice of the people\" has been heard and itsomewhat verifies that we still are living in a democracy.

Box 25007Denver, CO 80225-0007Dear Mr. Rizzi,I\\'m writing regarding the proposed changes in regulations for Bureau of Reclamation land surroundingCascade Lake. Following are the concerns my husband, David, and I have about the proposedregulations and how they will affect our dock ownership:Please change the proposed rule (43CFR Part 429) so that the Bureau of Reclamation does not have thepower to terminate dock permits without public comment. Obviously those of us who are affected byyour decisions would prefer that a public review process be followed before decisions are made thataffect our lives. Better, more informed decisions can be made if we are allowed to communicate ourconcerns, and if we can let you know how we will be affected by new regulations.Please define boat docks as \"Lesser Forms of Private Use\", and make it so that their use is governed byregional offices. This way, docks will not be regulated under the same umbrella as permanent homesand roads, and more thoughtful consideration can be given to the rules that govern their use.A homeowner should have the right to transfer ownership of his/her dock permit in conjunction with aproperty ownership transfer. This should be written as a part of the rule. The Bureau of Reclamationshould not have the power to make it difficult for ownership of the dock to be transferred, as long as theoriginal owner is in compliance with all existing permit requirements. Transferring ownership should bea simple matter of record-keeping on the part of the BOR.Residents who live along the narrow strip of federal land that lies between their homes and the highwater line, which is usually less than 150 feet from their homes, should be allowed, with the properpermits, to do minor landscaping and improvements such as stabilization walls, fire pits, and picnictables, and trimming of dead or diseased branches. With the proper permits to make sure that theenvironment is not impacted in a negative way, the work done by residents makes the shoreline moreuseable and attractive, and prevents erosion from negatively affecting water quality.BOR should inform permit-holders 90 days before their permits expire. This language should beincluded in the rule. In the event that a permit expires, the officials who issue the permits should havediscretionary authority to reissue the permits if, for example, the permit holder can show that he/shewasn\\'t notified of the expiration, or if there are other extenuating circumstances.Dock owners should be given six months, not 90 days, to repair damages to their docks. What if noticeis given that a dock needs to be repaired mid-winter? Repairs couldn\\'t be made until spring - a home-owner could lose her dock with the current 90 day limit. Also, dock repairs can be very expensive, and inthe current economic environment, a six month time limit to complete repairs seems more realistic.Thanks you for considering our concerns.Sincerely,Lynda J.

Myfamily has had a cabin on Lake Cascade for nearly 15 years and we have been faithfully paying the feeseach and every year. It is completely unfair to say that our not building a dock \"constitutes a presumptionof abandonment.\" Rather, you should presume that in paying the fees every year since 1994, we havealways planned on and dreamed of building a dock. In fact, our dock will be built within the next year aswe are undertaking a major renovation of our family\\'s cabin. My parents recently retired and wereplanning to spend a great deal of time at the cabin next summer. Sadly, this threat of losing our dockrights has made us wary of investing any more into this property that we have grown to love.Further, I cannot express to you enough how devastating it would be from both a financial and emotionalstandpoint to have a cabin on the lake without our own dock. Financially, you would be pocketing 15years of dock fees and even worse you would reduce the value of our cabin substantially. Emotionally.you would be taking away from our family\\'s enjoyment of going to the cabin. Summer is our favoriteseason with long days on the lake, taking the kids out on the boat and just enjoying each other and thebeauty of being on the water. My parents worked hard for their dream of having a cabin on the lake andnever would have chosen Lake Cascade without the right to their own dock. Like I said before, why elsewould they pay 15 years of fees?Please take a moment to thoroughly think this through and remove the second sentence of the revisedproposed rule referred to above.

Specifically, thesecomments address proposed change to subpart H, Prohibited and Unauthorized Uses of ReclamationLand, Facilities, and Waterbodies, which proposed to eliminate docks owned and maintained by privateindividuals through non-renewal of existing use authorizations.The opening paragraph of Section 429.31, which specifically addresses new structures, articulates anoverall desire to prohibit \"private exclusive recreation or residential use of Reclamation land, facilities,or waterbodies, or the perception thereof.\" Section 429.62 expands the desired prohibition to existingdocks, stating \"When authorizations for these uses expire, reclamation generally will not renew them.\"As landowners on Idaho\\'s Lake Cascade, we adamantly oppose this proposal for the following reasons:Our rural subdivision along Lake Cascade is a unique situation in which all property owners own land upto BOR land which we believe exempts our lake. All access to BOR land is obtained only by of waterand/or public access parks/camping facilities which currently coexist harmoniously.We do not perceiveto the public that we are exclusive users of public lands. We have owned our dock for many years andhave contributed to the safety of boaters and swimmers in the event of an emergency or stormsituation.Our docks are a safety link to the public in the event of spontaneous and dangerous storm,this is clearly indicated to all Lake Cascade users by warning signs located at boat docking and loadingareas. If there were no docks or areas to seek help many people and boats would be in great danger asthe danger of storms are very serious and quick acting.Elimination of docks and buoys in front of private residences will decrease accessibility to the reservoirand shoreline by the general public, not increase it. The BOR\\'s desire to fully eliminate the \"perceptionof private and exclusive use\" would call for the complete elimination of private residences and landownership bordering Reclamation waterways which is not practical. We have always practicedenvironmental compliance and preservation of this land through our personal funds as well as diligentlywork to stabilize the banks, mitigate erosion and clean beaches of debris and trash, etc. Also, we havecontributed through fees towards the economic need and maintenance of Lake Cascade. Individualdock owners have saved considerable tax payer dollars as they maintain and finance their own docksituations. By eliminating our docks, and the BOR replacing even half of the 300 private docks withpublic docks would be cost prohibitive, thus ensuring a substantial and unacceptable reduction in thenumber of available docks and deepwater moorings. Federal BOR funds would clearly be unable tosustain the present and future costs of such changes as they would be astronomical and a burden to alltax payers as well as depleting the ability to encourage economic stability, healthy grown and on goingmaintenance of Valley County.As property owners/public we are also opposed to fencing around the BOR land as it has been and willbe looked upon as a 11Spite\" fence by all lake users. A fence serves no real purpose or need and is awaste and drain of unnecessary taxpayer dollars from the installation and maintenance of themonstrosity. This would dramatically reduce the availability of BOR shores and amenities of waterwaysto homeowners to and public users. Lake Cascade is a major economic/recreational draw to ValleyCounty. The country is made up of small rural communities which encourage tourism to the area tohelp local businesses, communities and county sustain an income. Having Lake Cascade as a viablerecreation area useable and welcoming to all is a goal we all encourage as residents, members of thepublic, homeowners and taxpayers along the BOR land and water. We have harmoniously lived in thisenvironment for years and would like to maintain a positive relationship with the BOR well into thefuture for the mutual benefit of everyone recreating on Lake Cascade.We support and understand the Bureau of Reclamation\\'s commitment to make its waterways availableto all people, and we believe current regulations have mostly accomplished this goal. Elimination of thevast majority of available dock and mooring sites through this proposed rule will create fewer amenitiesfor all waterway users including those disabled. This unnecessary action substantially raises federalcapital expenditures, increased annual maintenance costs, and significantly increases a safety risk topublic recreation and their water craft.We urge and respectfully request that the continuance of existing public/private partnership previouslycreated on Bureau of Reclamation waterways. It has been for the most part, successful and beneficialfor all users.Respectfully,Dan and Ann VollumProperty OwnersDV/AV:srdSeptember 12, 2008Dan and Ann Vollum12876 Norwood Rd.Donnelly, Idaho 83615208-325-3057Bureau of ReclamationDenver Federal CenterP0 Box 25007Denver, CO 80225-0007Attn: Richard Rizzi, Mail Code 84-53000Re: Proposed Rule Comment ID 1006-AA51Docket ID #BOR-2008-0004To Whom It May Concern,This letter is responding to the Proposed Rule Citation Section 429.2. As a homeowner, we would liketo express our need for a dock as it offers protection and safe access to Lake Cascade. A one-size-fits-allpolicy would create a negative consequence for everyone. Defining boat docks as a \"Lesser Form ofPrivate Use\" is favorable and consistent with other regulatory agencies which would eliminate heavy-handed impacts on regulating boat docks under the same guidelines and definitions as \"permanentstructures\" which include cabins, roads etc.Our other concern is for the safety and well being of public boaters. By removing boat docks iteliminates a safety net for boaters and swimmers during storms and other emergencies. If there wereno docks or areas to seek help, many people would be in grave danger of spontaneous storm activity.Also, without the structure of a stair system there would not be safe access to the lake for homeownersor the public. The 25 foot vertical cliff leading to the shore from our land is accessible only by stairs andin place to prevent erosion and permanent damage to the cliffside. Our rural subdivision along LakeCascade is a unique situation in which all property owners own land adjacent to BOR. The issuespresented by both sides being addressed would conclude logically a definition for reason to exempt LakeCascade.We have at no time in the past or present perceived to the public that our use is exclusive andour docks are frequented by others. From an environmental standpoint, the perch population requiresthe shade provided by the docks for schooling and protection.We support and understand the BOR\\'s commitment to wake its waterways available to all people andwe believe current regulations have mostly accomplished this goal. Elimination of the vast majority ofavailable dock and mooring sites through this proposed rule, however, will create fewer amenities for allwaterway users including those disabled.

Listed below are suggested changes tothe proposed rule that we feel will fairly address the use of Reclamation land.1.§ 429.28 (3)Reclamation may, at any time... unilaterally terminate the use authorizationif Reclamation determines that: (i,)The use has become incompatible with authorizedproject purposes or a higher public use is identified.Agency decisions to terminate existing use rights should always be examined through apublic review process involving individuals affected by the decision as well as their localelected leaders.Unilateral termination authority with respect to individual permits mustinclude requirements to provide notice, statements of fact, legal basis for the decision beingmade, an opportunity to rebut the facts or legal basis cited and an opportunity to cure allegedtransgressions.2.§ 429.2 Definitions.Private exclusive recreational or residentialuse means any use thatinvolves structures or other improvements used for recreational or residential purposesto the exclusion ofpublic uses or which create the perception of such exclusion and arenot associated with the official management of a Reclamation project. This includes, butis not limited to, boat docks, cabin sites and associated inprovemenIs (including thosecurrently defined in part 21 of this title), residences, trailers, manufactured or mobilehomes, structures, roads, or other improvements as determined by Reclamation.The following is excerpted From Army Corps of EngineersSHORELThE MANAGEMENT PoLicy1130-2-406.Shoreline uses that do not interfere with authorized project purposes, public safetyconcerns, violate local norms, or result in sign Ulcant environmental affects should be allowedunless the public participation process identjfies problems in these areas.Recreational uses of BOR waterways should be governed under regional offices thatare knowledgeable about local conditions and issues. One-size-fits-all policies oftencreate unintended negative consequences. Defining boat docks asLesser Forms ofPrivate Use is consistent with other regulatory agencies and eliminates the heavy-handed impact of regulating boat docks under the same guidelines as permanentstructures likes cabins and roads.3.§429.32 (h)Requests for renewal, transfer, extension, or reissuance of useauthorizations for private exclusive recreational or residential usesauthorizations for private exclusive recreational or residential uses that expiredprior to the effective date of this part or are subsequently not renewed orterminated under the procedures of this section will be considered requests foruses prohibited under §429.31 and will not be approved. Conversely, requests fOrrenewal, transfer, extension, or reissuance of use authorizations for privateexclusive recreational or residential uses that were in existence on the effectivedate of these regulations and that are in compliance with all requirements of theapplicable use authorization at the time a request is made will not be consideredrequests for uses prohibited under §429.31, with transfers and assignments ofsuch use authorizations being subject to the requirements of §429.30.BOR officials have been clear in their desire to place obtaining permit renewals solely on thebacks of permit holders. Given the enormous penalty for missing a renewal date- permanentloss of one's dock - lack of any notice requirement on the part of BOR appears to be one moreattempt to remove lake docks one by one. By rule, BOR offices issuing permits should berequired to notify permit holders in writing to their address of record at least 90 days prior topermit expiration dates. BOR offices issuing permits should be given discretionary authority toreinstate lapsed permits where holders can show lack of notice or other extenuatingcircumstances.4.§429.32 (b)Reclamation will review all existing pri vate exclusive recreationalor residential uses fOr compliance with the required criteria at least once every 5years. Reclamation will provide the holder of the use authorization with writtenreport of the results of the compliance review.The report will state whether theexisting use meets the required criteria listed in this section and will list anydeficiencies that can be corrected. A minimum of 90 days will be provided tomake corrections identified in the report. Failure to correct the deficiencieswithin the time provided in the report will result in termination of the useauthorization.Ninety days is too short to repair a dock. Any dock inadequacies noted in Octobermight not be repairable until late spring because the lake is frozen or inaccessible.Changing the minimum period to make corrections to 270 days would betterrecognize the seasonal nature of waterways like Lake Cascade and the limited pool ofavailable contractors.Dock owners are willing to repair their docks; they just need areasonable amount of time in which to do so. Lake docks can now cost upwards of$25,000.The financial impact of replacing a dock or making costly repairs may beonerous for some when limited to a 90-day window. A 270-day period would betterallow for meeting the significant financial obligation of required improvements.There are many ways a dock owner can lose his or her dock, many of which are trapsfor the unwary. For example, if a family shares a cabin and dock permit and if oneowner drops the ball and fails to pay the permit fee - the whole family loses the dockpermit.A provision should be added to the rule that if the permit holder or hissuccessor cures the problem that caused the dock permit to be forfeited within fiveyears of the forfeiture (such as by paying the delinquent bill), the dock permit will bereinstated. In the alternative, a provision should be added to allow for situations thatmerit local BOR office discretion, such a reinstatement of permits lost due to specialcircumstances.We understand and support the Bureau of Reclamation's commitment to make itswaterways available to all people, and we believe the current regulations in placeaccomplish that goal.We encourage the Bureau not to put restrictions into the proposedrule that would reduce the use of this water body.We urge you to continue the existing public/private partnership currently in place at LakeCascade and to adjust the proposed rule to address the above issues.Sincer y,8325Wyndham LaneBoise, ID 83704cc:Dirk Kempthorne, Secretary of Interiorcc:Governor Butch Ottercc:Rep Bill Salicc: State Senator Lee I-Ieinrichcc: State Rep Ken Robertscc: Senator Mike Crapocc:Mr. Jerrold Gregg, Snake River Area Office\",\n",
       "  '7Dear Mr. Rizzi::Aug. 20, 2008I am writing to express my displeasure and disappointment in the operation of theDepartment of the Interior and the Bureau of Reclamation.Mr. Rizzi, you haveapparently decided to eliminate the boat docks at Lake Cascade, Idaho by any meanspossible. (Proposed Rule 1006 AA51) It now seems to have become a vendetta afterbeing rebuffed last year. Last year you came out and said boat docks were to be removed,but this was stymied by a public outcry. Now you are acting as a tyrannical bureaucratand sneaking in the back door. You are now trying to eliminate the docks by: attrition,outrageous permit prices, unilateral termination of a dock permit for unspecified reasons,not allowing automatic transfer of permits on sale of property or inheritance, and fmallyblanket refusal to issue new permits, not to mention threat of jail time for non-complianceIbelieve that the manner in which these decrees are being foisted upon a group ofAmerican people runs counter to the constitutional right of the people to enjoy thepursuit of happiness.The heavy handedness and sneaky attempted end run to get arounddock owners is appalling.Mr. Rizzi, the actions by you and your people are inappropriate and uncalled for. This isAmerica, not a Banana Republic. The denial of the use of a public resource is tantamountto expropriation without cause or justification.Sincerely yours,od NelsonP0 Box 1260and17535Caton Ct.Donnelly, ID 83615Riverside, CA92504',\n",

The rule leaves the decision of transferringminimal items like \"dock permits\" to the discretion of the BOR. This allows you, theBOR to remove docks or other permits systematically through attrition without anypublic coniment or recognizing local needs.The transfer of insignificant use permits like docks should be categorized separately frommajor use permit transfers under this rule, recognizing it is the intent of theBOR to transfer these types of use permits. This should only be an administrative action,subject to current compliance with the use permit, updating the BOR where to send thebill and the renewal agreement.erelyEd Johrson4990 Duck Lake DrGarden City ID 83714',\n",

Nelson627 East Peach StreetBozeman, MT 59715RE:Comments on Revised Proposed Rule on the use of Reclamation Land, Facilities, andWaterbodies (43 CFR part 429)Dear Richard Rizzi,As new trailer owners we are very concerned about having the ability to keep ourrecreational residence where it currently resides at Goose Bay on Canyon Ferry Lake, Montana.We strongly feel that as hard working Montanans this recreational residence is the only affordablechoice that offers long term recreational opportunities to us and our families. The idea to removethese few trailers at Goose Bay to make room for more RV parking seems to cater to those moreaffluent and takes away well deserved opportunities for us hard working folks from Montana.As long term residents we feel we are better stewards of the land than short term RV campersand we have a more vested interest in the care and maintenance of the surrounding areas weenjoy.By maintaining the permanent recreational residences at Goose Bay the Bureau ofReclamation will be insuring the residents' cooperative involvement toward the long term safetyand impact of these sites. In addition, the hard work these long term residents apply toward thecare and maintanence of these sites not only reduces the impact on the land, but enhances itsnatural beauty for others to enjoy. It is in the best interest of the United States to not trade ourhard work for expensive RV sites. I trust you will do the right thing and let us recreationalresidents remain as the devoted stewards we are.Thank you for your consideration of these matters,Erik NelsonCo-owner of Trailer #29Goose Bay MarinaTownsend, MontanaRevised Proposed Rule on the use of Reclamation Land, Facilities,and Waterbodies (43 CFR Part 429)August 21, 2008(Please Print Clearly)Name2-/LV4/t2and Address('2-6ti'ip-2.--2Phone (l4tjO-- q-t7gFAX (E-mailole(aJ1fjs'3+ccIOL&dNarrative Comments:-Attach additional sheets if necessary-Before including your address, phone number, e-mail address, or other personal identifying information inyour comment, be advised that your entire comment - including your personal identifying information - maybe made publicly available at any time.

       "  converted to public use areas.\n",
       "      Response: Due to the overwhelming reaction received during the \n",

       "  to provide high quality recreation opportunities.\n",
       "      Comment: It appears that the intent of the proposed rule is to \n",
       "  phase out all private access to Reclamation waterbodies. This would \n",

       "  Reclamation's intent for proposing Subpart H of the proposed rule.\n",
       "      Response: The reason we are including Subpart H is because it is \n",
       "  our responsibility to notify the public of uses that are prohibited on \n",
       "  Reclamation land, facilities, and waterbodies; thus the primary purpose \n",
       "  of Subpart H. Based on the comments received in 2007, we have revised \n",
       "  our approach with regard to existing private exclusive recreational and \n",
       "  residential use, while maintaining the prohibition on any new such \n",
       "  uses.\n",
       "  1. Regulatory Planning and Review (Executive Order (E.O.) 12866)\n",
       "      Comment: Under paragraph (a) this is a significant rule which under \n",
       "  E.O. 12866 will have an effect of $100 million or more on the economy \n",
       "  due to additional financial burdens being placed on the public.\n",
       "      Response: The proposed rule actually lessens some of the impacts \n",
       "  placed on the economy. As an example, the application fee is reduced \n",
       "  from $200 to $100 in the proposed rule. The total amount of fees and \n",
       "  charges we annually collect for uses of Reclamation land, facilities, \n",
       "  and waterbodies is well under $100 million.\n",
       "      Comment: Paragraph (b) states that this rule would not create a \n",
       "  serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with actions of another \n",
       "  Federal agency. Other Federal agencies, however, seemingly continue to \n",
       "  allow for private exclusive recreational or residential uses.\n",
       "      Response: Each Federal agency has authorities, regulations, and \n",
       "  policies that are unique to their mission and responsibilities and will \n",
       "  necessarily result in differing practices for the management of lands \n",
       "  and resources. How we address private exclusive recreational and \n",
       "  residential uses has no impact on how other Federal agencies address \n",
       "  that issue.\n",
       "  2. Regulatory Flexibility Act\n",
       "      Comment: Because this rule expands use fees and authorizations to \n",
       "  include navigable waterbodies and facilities, many associated small \n",
       "  businesses will be required to submit reports to the agency to comply \n",
       "  with the fee determining process.\n",

       "  paid for authorized uses of Reclamation waterbodies and facilities \n",
       "  pursuant to OMB Circular A-25; the proposed rule does not expand on \n",
       "  that requirement. Additionally, the proposed rule does not impose a \n",

       "      Comment: The expansion of fees and cost recovery to facilities and \n",
       "  waterbodies could result in increased costs or prices for consumers, \n",
       "  individual industries, etc.\n",
       "      Response: Section 429.1 of the current rule requires that \n",
       "  applicable fees and cost recovery be assessed for the authorized use of \n",
       "  Reclamation lands as well as facilities and waterbodies. The proposed \n",
       "  rule does not expand on that requirement.\n",
       "  5. Takings (E.O. 12630 and E.O. 13406)\n",
       "      Comment: Reclamation's determination that this proposed rule would \n",
       "  have no implications for takings of private property rights is invalid.\n",
       "      Response: This rule applies only to Reclamation land, facilities, \n",
       "  and waterbodies. Any private personal property lawfully placed on \n",
       "  Reclamation land, facilities, or waterbodies is there only by our \n",
       "  permission through a use authorization. No real property rights are \n",
       "  conveyed for Reclamation land, facilities, and waterbodies through such \n",

       "      Comment: In general, the proposed rule is vague, confusing, and/or \n",
       "  inconsistent in content.\n",
