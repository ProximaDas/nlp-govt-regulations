       " SUMMARY: This rule proposes adjustments in current fees for consular \n",
       " services. The Department of State is adjusting the fees in light of an \n",
       " independent cost of service study's (``CoSS'') findings that the U.S. \n",
       " Government is not fully covering its costs for providing these services \n",
       " under the current fee structure. The primary objective of the \n",
       " adjustments to the Schedule of Fees is to ensure that fees for consular \n",
       " services reflect costs to the United States of providing the services.\n",

       " Bureau of Consular Affairs (``Schedule of Fees'' or ``Schedule''), as \n",
       " well as a conforming amendment to 22 CFR 51.51(d). As discussed below, \n",
       " full cost recovery is the basis on which consular fees are ordinarily \n",
       " set and collected. In line with this principle, the Department has \n",
       " reviewed its current consular fees based on a recently completed CoSS, \n",
       " and decided to implement a number of changes to the Schedule of Fees.\n",
       "     Two of these changes are particularly noteworthy. First, the \n",
       " proposed rule establishes a tiered application processing fee for \n",
       " immigrant visas depending on the category, as determined by the cost to \n",
       " the U.S. Government of processing that particular category of visa. \n",
       " Second, the proposed rule increases the adult passport book application \n",
       " fee from $55 to $70 to make this fee more consistent with full cost \n",
       " recovery. Moreover, certain consular services performed for no fee are \n",
       " included in the Schedule so that members of the public will be aware of \n",
       " significant consular services provided by the Department for which they \n",
       " will not be charged.\n",
       "     Nonimmigrant visa fees, including fees for Machine-Readable Visas \n",
       " (MRVs) and Border Crossing Cards (BCCs), have been modified pursuant to \n",
       " a separate rule published December 14, 2009. These modified fees are \n",
       " reflected in Item 21 of the Schedule below.\n",
       " \n",
       " What Is the Authority for This Action?\n",
       " \n",
       "     The Department of State derives the general authority to set the \n",
       " amount of fees for the consular services it provides, and to charge \n",
       " those fees, from the general user charges statute, 31 U.S.C. 9701. See, \n",
       " e.g., 31 U.S.C. 9701(b)(2)(A) (``The head of each agency * * * may \n",
       " prescribe regulations establishing the charge for a service or thing of \n",
       " value provided by the agency * * * based on * * * the costs to the \n",
       " Government * * *.''). As implemented through Executive Order 10718 of \n",
       " June 27, 1957, 22 U.S.C. 4219 further authorizes the Department to \n",
       " establish fees to be charged for official services provided by U.S. \n",
       " embassies and consulates. Other authorities allow the Department to \n",
       " charge fees for consular services, but not to determine the amount of \n",
       " such fees, as the amount is statutorily determined. Examples include: \n",
       " (1) The $13 fee for machine-readable BCCs for certain Mexican citizen \n",
       " minors, Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations \n",
       " Act of 1999, Public Law 105-277, 112 Stat. 2681-50, Div. A, Title IV, \n",
       " sec. 410(a) (reproduced at 8 U.S.C. 1351 note); and (2) the reciprocal \n",
       " nonimmigrant visa issuance fee, 8 U.S.C. 1351.\n",
       "     A number of other statutes address specific fees relating to \n",
       " passport processing, immigrant and nonimmigrant visa processing, and \n",
       " overseas citizens services. For example, 22 U.S.C. 214 authorizes the \n",
       " Department to charge passport application and execution fees. Another \n",
       " law authorizes the Department to establish a fee for the processing of \n",
       " applications for ``diversity visas,'' to recover the costs of the \n",
       " ``visa lottery'' program conducted under Immigration and Nationality \n",
       " Act (INA) sections 203 and 222, 8 U.S.C. 1153, 1201. See Omnibus \n",

       " Only those applicants who register in the lottery and are selected may \n",
       " apply for a visa, and those who choose to apply must pay the fee; the \n",
       " fee incorporates the costs to the Department of administering the \n",
       " lottery program. Id. Another statute authorizes the Department to \n",
       " collect and retain surcharges on passports and immigrant visas to help \n",
       " pay for efforts to enhance border security. See 8 U.S.C. 1714. While \n",
       " these fees were originally frozen statutorily at $12 and $45 \n",
       " respectively, subsequent legislation authorized the Department to amend \n",
       " these amounts administratively, provided the resulting surcharge is \n",
       " ``reasonably related to the costs of providing services in connection \n",
       " with the activity or item for which the surcharges are charged.'' \n",
       " Department of State Authorities Act of 2006, Public Law 109-472, 120 \n",
       " Stat. 3554, sec. 6(b)(1) (reproduced at 8 U.S.C. 1714 note). \n",
       " Furthermore, several statutes deal with fees for nonimmigrant visas, \n",
       " including the issuance fee statute described above, 8 U.S.C. 1351 \n",
       " (establishing reciprocity as the basis for the nonimmigrant visa \n",
       " issuance fee), and the MRV and BCC fees modified in the proposed rule \n",
       " published in the Federal Register on December 14, 2009.\n",
       "     Certain persons are exempted by law or regulation from paying \n",
       " specific fees or are expressly made subject to a special fee regime by \n",

       " SUMMARY: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) proposes to adjust \n",
       " certain immigration and naturalization benefit request fees charged by \n",
       " U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). USCIS conducted a \n",
       " comprehensive fee review, after refining its cost accounting process, \n",
       " and determined that current fees do not recover the full costs of the \n",
       " services it provides. Adjustment to the fee schedule is necessary to \n",
       " fully recover costs for USCIS services and to maintain adequate \n",
       " service. DHS proposes to increase USCIS fees by a weighted average of \n",
       " 21 percent and add one new fee. In addition, DHS proposes to clarify \n",
       " that persons filing a benefit request may be required to appear for \n",
       " biometrics services or an interview and pay the biometrics services \n",
       " fee, and make a number of other changes.\n",

       " agency has experienced elevated processing times compared to the goals \n",
       " established in FY 2007. These processing delays have contributed to \n",

       " recover costs related to the USCIS Refugee, Asylum, and International \n",
       " Operations Directorate (RAIO), SAVE, and the Office of Citizenship. \n",
       " This was done in anticipation of Congress granting the request for \n",
       " annual discretionary appropriations to fund these programs that was in \n",
       " the President's Budget. Those resources did not fully materialize and \n",
       " since FY 2012 USCIS has used other fee revenue to support these \n",
       " programs. DHS is proposing to adjust fees by a total weighted average \n",
       " increase of 21 percent; the total 21 percent weighted average increase \n",
       " would be allocated as follows:\n",
       "     <bullet> Reinstate a surcharge in the fee schedule to fully fund \n",
       " RAIO, SAVE, and the Office of Citizenship (approximately 8 percent);\n",
       "     <bullet> Account for reduced revenue stemming from an increase in \n",
       " fee waivers granted since FY 2010 (approximately 9 percent); and\n",
       "     <bullet> Recover the costs needed to sustain current operating \n",

       " ensure the agency's information technology infrastructure is \n",
       " strengthened to protect against potential cyber intrusions, and to \n",
       " build the necessary disaster recovery and back-up capabilities required \n",
       " to effectively deliver the USCIS mission (approximately 4 percent).\n",
       "     Through this rule, USCIS expects to collect sufficient fee revenue \n",
       " to fully support RAIO, SAVE and the Office of Citizenship. This would \n",
       " allow USCIS to discontinue diverting fee revenue to fund these \n",

       " \n",
       "     When conducting a fee review, USCIS reviews its recent cost \n",
       " history, operating environment, and current service levels to determine \n",
       " the appropriate method to assign costs to particular benefit requests. \n",
       " The methodology used in the review reflects a robust capability to \n",
       " calculate, analyze, and project costs and revenues.\n",
       "     USCIS uses commercially available ABC software to create financial \n",
       " models to calculate the costs for processing immigration benefit \n",
       " requests, including the costs for biometric services. Following the FY \n",
       " 2010/2011 Fee Rule, USCIS identified several key methodology changes to \n",
       " improve the accuracy of its ABC model, as discussed in the \n",
       " ``Methodology for the 2016/2017 Fee Review'' section in the Supporting \n",
       " Documentation. USCIS continues to update the ABC model with the most \n",
       " current information for fee review and cost management purposes.\n",
       " \n",
       " A. Background\n",
       " \n",
       "     ABC is a business management tool that assigns resource costs to \n",
       " operational activities and then to products and services. These \n",
       " assignments provide an accurate cost assessment of each work stream \n",
       " involved in producing the individual outputs of an agency or \n",
       " organization. The Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) \n",
       " notes that ABC helps improve product costing by avoiding arbitrary \n",

       " 1. ABC Methodology\n",
       "     DHS has included FY 2016/2017 Fee Review Supporting Documentation, \n",
       " including a detailed report on how it calculated the fee schedule \n",
       " proposed in the docket for this rulemaking. Comments are welcome on the \n",
       " supporting documentation and all aspects of this proposal. A summary of \n",
       " the fee study, calculations, methodology and conclusions follows.\n",
       " a. Resources\n",
       "     Resources equal the projected FY 2016/2017 annual cost baseline of \n",
       " $3.0 billion. USCIS designed the ABC model structure for FY 2016/2017 \n",
       " to resemble the structure of the FY 2015 annual operating plan. That \n",
       " plan is the detailed budget execution plan USCIS establishes at the \n",
       " beginning of the fiscal year consistent with the approved fiscal year \n",
       " spending authority and forecasted fee revenue.\n",
       " b. Resource Drivers and Resource Assignment\n",
       "     ABC uses resource drivers to assign resources to activities. (See \n",
       " Section VI.A.1.c. of this preamble for more information.) All resource \n",
       " costs are assigned to activities, so the total resources in the model \n",
       " equal the total cost of activities.\n",
       "     A common resource driver in ABC is the number of employees in an \n",
       " organization and the percentage of time they spend performing various \n",
       " activities. The FY 2016/2017 ABC model uses employee counts and \n",
       " activity information to assign resources to activities. USCIS refers to \n",
       " this process as the payroll title analysis. The payroll title analysis \n",
       " determines how employees contribute to the eleven activities in the fee \n",
       " review. When an office engages in more than one activity, USCIS uses \n",
       " operational information to prorate that office's time to multiple \n",
       " activities. Historical activity information is applied to projected \n",
       " staffing levels in FY 2016/2017. The ABC model assigns resources to \n",
       " activities using anticipated staffing levels and historical activity \n",
       " information from the payroll title analysis for each office.\n",
       "     USCIS assigns some costs directly to activities. For example, the \n",
       " contract awarded to support USCIS Application Support Center operations \n",
       " only pertains to the ``Perform Biometric Services'' activity. \n",
       " Therefore, the costs of this contract are assigned directly to this \n",
       " activity. Other overhead costs, including costs for the Office of \n",
       " Information Technology, service-level agreements, and USCIS \n",
       " contributions to the DHS working capital fund are prorated to each \n",
       " office based on the number of authorized positions in those offices, so \n",
       " that each office pays a proportionate share.\n",
       "     The allocation methods in the FY 2016/2017 review are in line with \n",
       " FASAB's Standard 4 on managerial cost accounting concepts. This \n",
       " fulfills the guideline for agencies to directly trace costs when \n",

       " See 8 CFR 103.7(c). To request a fee waiver, the individual must submit \n",
       " a written waiver request for permission to have their benefit request \n",
       " processed without payment. The waiver request must state the person's \n",
       " belief that he or she is entitled to or deserving of the benefit \n",
       " requested, the reasons for his or her inability to pay, and evidence to \n",
       " support the reasons indicated. See 8 CFR 103.7(c)(2). There is no \n",
       " appeal of the denial of a fee waiver request. See id. Before 2007, \n",
       " USCIS could waive any fee, even where the fee waiver would be \n",
       " inconsistent with the underlying benefit request. For example, prior to \n",
       " 2007, USCIS could waive fees for companies seeking to sponsor foreign \n",
       " workers; individuals seeking status based on substantial business \n",
       " investments; or individuals seeking to sponsor foreign relatives to \n",
       " whom the sponsors must provide a financial safety net. See 72 FR 4912. \n",
       " Since 2007, however, DHS has limited the USCIS fees that may be waived \n",
       " in 8 CFR 103.7(c)(3) based on the general premise that fee waivers must \n",
       " be consistent with any financial considerations that apply to the \n",
       " status or benefit sought. See 8 CFR 103.7(c)(1)(ii).\n",
       "     Following the 2010 Fee Rule, USCIS also issued guidance to the \n",

       " that USCIS is able to recover the full costs of the immigration \n",
       " services it provides and maintain adequate service. In addition to \n",
       " increasing fees, USCIS proposes the following amendments: provisions \n",
       " that USCIS will reject an immigration benefit request paid with a \n",
       " dishonored check; provisions that USCIS will reject an application that \n",
       " does not include the required biometric services fee; the institution \n",

       " and provisions that fee refunds will be provided at USCIS discretion.\n",
       " a. Dishonored Payments\n",
       "     Earlier in this preamble USCIS explains its proposal to change how \n",
       " it will treat a benefit request accompanied by fee payment (in the form \n",
       " of check or other financial instrument) that is subsequently returned \n",
       " as not payable.\\88\\ Current regulations provide that when a check or \n",
       " other financial instrument used to pay a filing fee is subsequently \n",
       " returned as not payable, the remitter will be notified and requested to \n",
       " pay the filing fee and associated service charge within 14 calendar \n",
       " days, without extension.\\89\\ If the benefit request is pending and \n",
       " these charges are not paid within 14 days, the benefit request will be \n",
       " rejected as improperly filed. In addition, a receipt issued by a DHS \n",
       " officer for any remittance will not be binding upon DHS if the \n",
       " remittance is found uncollectable, and legal and statutory deadlines \n",
       " will not be deemed to have been met if payment is not made within 10 \n",
       " business days after notification by DHS of the dishonored check.\\90\\ In \n",
       " accordance with these provisions, when a payment is returned as not \n",
       " payable, USCIS places the immigration benefit request on hold, and \n",
       " suspends adjudication. If the check was dishonored or payment fails, \n",
       " USCIS assesses a $30 penalty and pursues the unpaid fee and penalty \n",
       " using administrative debt collection procedures.\\91\\ If payment is made \n",
       " within the allotted time, USCIS resumes processing the application or \n",
       " benefit request. If a payment is not corrected by the applicant, USCIS \n",
       " rejects the filing for nonpayment.\\92\\\n",

       " applicants who file an application with the correct fees. In addition, \n",
       " the proposed amendments would lower USCIS administrative costs for \n",
       " holding and tracking applications and payments. The holding and \n",
       " tracking of applications requires physical storage space that would no \n",
