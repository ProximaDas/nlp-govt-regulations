Reg. 67254. The proposed rule would require employers to electronically submit injury and illness records (300A, 300, 301) to OSHA, which would be made publically available through an online database.\\n\\nI believe exceptional jobsite safety and health practices are inherently good for business. However, the proposed rule does nothing to achieve OSHA's stated goal of reducing injuries, illnesses and fatalities, and instead will force employers to consume large amounts of time and resources on electronic reporting that could be put towards better use. \\n\\nThe proposed rule will allow OSHA to obtain and release to the public detailed information regarding specific workplace injuries and illnesses, including the company, location and incident-specific data. However, this information is not a reliable measure of my company's safety records or its efforts to promote a safe work environment. OSHA would be providing this information to the public without any meaningful context, and I'm very concerned about the data being misconstrued by the public and improper conclusions or assumptions being made about my business. This proposal could easily lead to unwarranted damage to my company's reputation and result in loss of jobs and future work.\\n\\nOSHA's proposal will require my company to submit confidential business details to the agency. This proprietary information would be disclosed to my competitors, and those aiming to threaten or disrupt the security and overall operations of my business. In addition, OSHA also asks the employer to submit sensitive personal information about my employees. Although the agency has stated that it will redact certain personal information from the public disclosures, it has also failed to adequately explain to stakeholders how it plans to accomplish the task. Even with the redaction of names, addresses, physicians, I am concerned that other information could nonetheless unfairly identify an employee. \\n\\nIn the proposal, OSHA states the information received through the mandatory electronic filing of injury and illness records could be used for enforcement efforts. This goes against decades of practice by OSHA, suggesting now that all incidents are the fault of the employer, failing to account for accidents that could be beyond an employers' control. OSHA is now attempting to shame employers into compliance by using data that fails to show the complete narrative of the company's safety record. \\n\\nFinally, OSHA has greatly underestimated the cost this rulemaking will have on businesses.  The agency has failed to account for the time spent training employees, the additional time taken by employers to determine if an injury or illness is work-related, and the costs included with implementing an electronic recordkeeping system. Before the agency moves forward, it must go back and review the costs associated with the proposal. \\n\\nFor all the reasons outlined above, I urge OSHA to withdraw this proposal.  \\n\\nThank you for the opportunity to submit comments on this matter.\",\n",

       "  \"Monday, October 13, 2014 \\n\\nDavid Michaels \\nAssistant Secretary \\nU.S. Department of Labor \\n200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.\\nWashington, D.C. 20210 \\nFax: (202) 693-1646 \\n\\nRE: Docket No. OSHA-2013-0023: Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses\\n\\nDear Assistant Secretary Michaels:\\n\\nAs a construction trade association, we would like to submit the following comments to the U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in response to the above-referenced supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking published In the Federal Register on Aug. 14, 2014. \\n\\nWhile the supplemental rulemaking could appear to some to be trivial in nature, the examples provided in support of the proposed rule could force drastic changes to our member's safety policies and we strongly urge OSHA to withdraw it.  Some of our specific concerns regarding the examples include: prohibiting random and post-accident drug testing, prohibiting our members to reassign employees who have not followed company safety policies or been involved in accidents that are under investigation, prohibiting safety counseling of workers who don't follow company safety procedures, and prohibiting employers from escalating discipline of habitual safety policy violators.  Each of these actions help make safety a priority on our members job sites.  The ability to develop and enforce safety procedures is critical to our member's ability to protect the entire workforce.\\n\\nThe proposed changes will also have a direct impact on our member's ability to conduct timely incident/accident investigations.  This could be especially problematic on jobsites with multiple employers, which is very common in the construction industry.  Timely communication of safety and health hazards is necessary to ensure corrective actions are implemented to protect the safety of one's coworkers.  Additionally, the proposed changes could encourage delayed injury reporting, which will lead to delayed treatment for the injured/ill employee.  It could also result in inaccurate claims as employers may be held liable for incidents that may not have occurred on their jobsites due to the inability to enforce timely incident/accident reporting policies.\\n\\nThe best construction companies have aggressive safety policies.  They quickly address hazards, quickly treat the injured, and take aggressive action to retrain employees who have accidentally injured themselves or others; they also take a dim view of employees who ignore safety policies and habitually endanger themselves and their coworkers. Many of the safety policies that could be prohibited by this proposal are commonplace in today's businesses, promote a safe and healthy workplace, and are not designed to discourage injury or illness reporting.  OSHA may be overreacting to anecdotes that are not representative of construction industry activities.  There are laws that prohibit discrimination for reporting injuries and illnesses.  OSHA's supplemental rulemaking may be well-intentioned, but it will prohibit many proven, effective safety practices that allow employers to make workplace safety and health a high priority for every person on a construction job site. \\n\\nFor all these reasons, we urge OSHA to withdraw the rulemaking.  Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on this matter. \\n\\nRespectfully submitted, \\n\\n\\nMr. Ricke W. Welden \\nDirector of Field Services\\nAssociated General Contractors of Iowa\\n701 E. Court Ave., Ste. B\\nDes Moines, IA 50309\\nemail: rwelden@agcia.org\\n\",\n",

This information should be considered the private and personal information of the company and employee concerned.  The proposed use of data does not tell the full story about the circumstances surrounding and injury and efforts to prevent injuries by the business owner.  I also feel that the public release of this information may invite intrusion into our company affairs by unscrupulous persons.  Please rethink this change in policy of \"naming and shaming\" as a means to improve safety.  The environment that small business has to operate under becomes more complex every year.

       "  \"At first I thought his was a joke, an internet prank, or a spin jockey looking to get a story going. Now II see that these proposed rule changes are ACTUALLY being considered.  If you are going to enact such restrictions on American businesses and those to work at maintaining a safe workplace, you are in the process of derailing that entire process and every 1910 rule ever set in place.  I not only manage the EHS programs for my company, but also the worker's compensation programs. If these rules go into effect, I might as well just hand every employee a credit card to charge every personal injury they have at home and work back to the employer.  OSHA was supposed to stand for accountability, but these rule changes fly in the face of that charge. Allowing no reasonable time period for employees to report injuries would translate to employees filing claims against me for accidents they had 3 - 13 years ago at home, and me unable to prove any difference.  Having removed the post drug and alcohol policy will not only put each individual at risk, but all co-workers and the general public at risk.  In my 27 years administering over companys EHS program, I have through a drug and alcohol testing program identified 21 persons who were working under the influence. Every person in the United States has a right to work in a hazard free workplace, and allowing some employees to work under the influence is a slap in the face of everyone else that expects a drug free workplace as a norm of employment.  These rule changes take all of that away and will make it nearly impossible for workplaces to achieve a zero injury workplace by stripping any check and balance to the system that quite frankly, OSHA created. All this legislation will do is drive those companies that value a safe workplace and safe workforce out of business or out of the country.  It will encourage and enable those that abuse the system to have a free reign to do whatever they want, get away with fraud, misuse the workers compensation programs, and drive the costs of all goods and services to a point where no one will be able to afford them, hence destroying our way of life. Every system needs a set of checks and balances, and these rule changes wipe them all out.\",\n",

       "  '\\tCurrently, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is proposing new rules to be implemented in order to make the workplace much safer to be at. These new rules would improve the tracking of workplace injuries and illnesses. This would lead to employees being much safer and better off for the future if there were better kept records of their sick days. With these new rules it would make is so that the OSHA could see at any time the records of all the employees in any other the businesses that they choose. They could also see with much easier access which industries have the highest sickness and injury rates. \\n\\n\\tAnother one of the main reason why the OSHA would like to improve the tracking of injuries and illnesses to also help identify and eliminate the hazards that are the cause of employees missing work. With finding this hazards and getting rid of them or making them safer for everyone around them, the workplace will be much safer and as a result there will be less people missing work due to illness or injury. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration would not be proposing these new rules and laws to be implemented if they did not think that it is in the benefit of every member of the labor supply. Knowing where these illnesses and injuries are coming from would keep everyone safer and healthier. \\n\\n\\tThis would allow immediate access to the records and the OSHA would know about any employee they need to, any previous illnesses or conditions that an employee might have, where they work, and what they do. This could be crucial in emergency situations, and may even be life and death in serious workplace accidents. Currently, it takes the OSHA some time to get access to these important documents; if this passes then it will all be digitalized and organized into a system. This would benefit the employees, companies, and the safety of everyone in the workplace. \\n\\n\\tAs for identifying and knowing these hazards, it will help the companies, employees, researchers, and the government to help distinguish what is the most dangerous for the people working there. It would also not be much of an inconvenience for the OSHA, it would take some time to input the information into the computer system but the companies could also help to make the transition much easier. Overall, it would be worth it to have everything in the system, which most companies probably already do and could have it transported to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration without a hassle. \\n\\n\\tCurrently, the OSHA requires the employers to have an injury or illness record for each employee that falls ill or becomes injured at the workplace. This new law will just change the way the process is done. It will require the same information and will still the responsibility of the employer and makes it an easier process for OSHA to retain the information of the ill and injured employees. This proposed law will make the entire workforce safer for everyone in it. \\n',\n",

       "  'After reviewing the proposed rule change background and summary, I believe an amendment to 29 CFR Parts 1904 and 1952 is warranted.  Since the most recent amendment in 2002, technology has advanced so that electronic filing of the 300 and 300A forms and the ability for OSHA to have access to the reported information, is necessary for the continued safety of employers and employees.\\n\\nI agree that the amendment to increase the frequency of reporting requirements to a quarterly basis for employers with an excess of 250 employees is positive.  Due to the economic downturn, many employers have laid off employees and therefore, the remaining employees are burdened with the additional workload, thereby increasing the opportunity for injury.  In addition, as employers’ bottom line has decreased, the opportunity for them to refrain from spending monies to create and maintain a safe working environment will be impacted.  \\n\\nI disagree with the amendment to change the employer reporting requirements to include only those employers with an excess of 20 or more employees.  I feel that the minimum employee count of 10 or more should be reduced to state, “employers with one (1) or more employees are required to report injuries/illnesses”.  I believe that employers with fewer employees are more likely to “skimp” on safety maintenance, therefore creating an increased propensity for injury.  If your mission is “to assure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women”, all men and women should be covered by this regulation.\\n\\nI adamantly oppose the amendment which, if passed, will approve online posting of establishment-specific injury and illness information which the public will have access to view.  I do not believe that “shaming” employers into being safer should be the goal.  Will this amendment not force the employer to cover-up injuries so as not to bring a bad name on their business?  I understand the importance of having the information available to other employers to compare industry specific injuries and set benchmarks for training and prevention; however, allowing the public to view this information will only encourage the litigious prospective employee or consumer to visit that location and engage in acts that could allow them to sue the employer.  I am positive this is not the intention, but today this type of act is commonplace.\\n\\nOverall, I believe the amended OSH Act 29 CFR Parts 1904 and 1952 will allow OSHA an increase in their ability to be aware of establishment-specific injury and illness data which will in turn allow for increase identification and abatement of workplace hazards.  I do not believe, however, that some of the issues which I have noted above, have been researched to an extent that will keep the employers from becoming a target.  \\n\\nPlease consider my comments and research these areas further before amending the regulation.\\n',\n",

Reg. 67254. The proposed rule would require employers to electronically submit injury and illness records (300A, 300, 301) to OSHA, which would be made publically available through an online database.\\n\\nI believe exceptional jobsite safety and health practices are inherently good for business. However, the proposed rule does nothing to achieve OSHA's stated goal of reducing injuries, illnesses and fatalities, and instead will force employers to consume large amounts of time and resources on electronic reporting that could be put towards better use. \\n\\nThe proposed rule will allow OSHA to obtain and release to the public detailed information regarding specific workplace injuries and illnesses, including the company, location and incident-specific data. However, this information is not a reliable measure of my company's safety records or its efforts to promote a safe work environment. OSHA would be providing this information to the public without any meaningful context, and I'm very concerned about the data being misconstrued by the public and improper conclusions or assumptions being made about my business. This proposal could easily lead to unwarranted damage to my company's reputation and result in loss of jobs and future work.\\n\\nOSHA's proposal will require my company to submit confidential business details to the agency. This proprietary information would be disclosed to my competitors, and those aiming to threaten or disrupt the security and overall operations of my business. In addition, OSHA also asks the employer to submit sensitive personal information about my employees. Although the agency has stated that it will redact certain personal information from the public disclosures, it has also failed to adequately explain to stakeholders how it plans to accomplish the task. Even with the redaction of names, addresses, physicians, I am concerned that other information could nonetheless unfairly identify an employee. \\n\\nIn the proposal, OSHA states the information received through the mandatory electronic filing of injury and illness records could be used for enforcement efforts. This goes against decades of practice by OSHA, suggesting now that all incidents are the fault of the employer, failing to account for accidents that could be beyond an employers' control. OSHA is now attempting to shame employers into compliance by using data that fails to show the complete narrative of the company's safety record. \\n\\nFinally, OSHA has greatly underestimated the cost this rulemaking will have on businesses.  The agency has failed to account for the time spent training employees, the additional time taken by employers to determine if an injury or illness is work-related, and the costs included with implementing an electronic recordkeeping system.

       "  'Comments of Mark Catlin, Industrial Hygienist, on OSHA’s proposed rule on Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses, Docket Number OSHA-2013-0023\\n\\nI am writing to express my strong support for OSHA’s proposal [Docket No.OSHA-2013-0023] to add requirements for electronic submission of information on occupational injuries and illnesses that employers are already required to keep under OSHA’s record-keeping rule.  I also strongly support OSHA’s proposed plans to make some of this data available in a public database.\\n\\nThis data will be especially beneficial for occupational medicine clinic staff in the prevention and treatment of occupational and environmental illnesses and injuries. For several years in the 1990s, I worked as the industrial hygienist at the Harborview Occupational Medicine Clinic at the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington.  A major focus of my work was to gather information to best understand the workplace environment of the patients seen in our clinic.  This information was needed to assist the clinic physicians in their diagnosis and treatment of their patients and decision-making of return to work and hazard abatement issues.\\n\\nHaving access to a facility’s injury and illness logs would have been of tremendous aid in understanding the workplace of our patients.  We did not generally request this information from our patients, even though they had a legal right to this information, because of our concern with employer retaliation.  Too often, our patients were terminated from their work by their employer for simply coming to our clinic.  Having access to a facility’s logs, without this concern, would been a wonderful resource.\\n\\nThanks to OSHA for proposing this advancement in the tracking and use of workplace injuries and illnesses.  \\n',\n",

       "  'RE:      Docket No. OSHA-2013-0023\\n\\n            Proposed Rule to Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses\\n\\nTo Whom It May Concern:\\n\\nI appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to establish improvements for tracking of workplace injuries and illnesses. Work safety and the health of my family and my employees is a top priority for my family farm and something we focus on every day in New York.\\n\\nI have some serious concerns about this rule related to privacy and safety, and I urge OSHA to withdraw this prosed regulation.\\n\\nThe proposed rule would require employers to electronically submit injury and illness information currently in the 300A, 300, 301 Forms to OSHA. Employers with 20 or more employees would have to report annually with no paper options. The agency also would have discretion under the proposal to require any employer to submit more detailed information about specific injuries and illnesses. A major concern is that fact that OSHA has not been able to justify its reasoning for how this data will be used.\\n\\nOSHA intends to provide public online access to the injury and illness records so the public, including employers, employees, potential employees, researchers, consumers, and labor organizations and businesses will have full accessibility to this data. Currently, farmers are required to complete injury information for OSHA’s use, however, the information is not generally available to the public and is available only to researchers on a basis consistent with confidential data. The injury data will be released without proper context relating to how or why an accident occurred. Without the proper context, the data will not be reflected as a reliable measure of an employer’s safety records or its efforts to promote a safe work environment. This could lead to misinterpretation of data and false assumptions and conclusions about an employer. It presents the opportunity for interest groups to mischaracterize and misuse information for topics unrelated to safety.\\n\\nAllowing private information such as the company name, location, home addresses, home contact information, and incident-specific data to become public information raises privacy concerns for farmers. Since many farmers live where they work, this creates a direct threat. Not only could this affect the safety of the employer but that of family members and employees. The data may be used for unintended purposes by those who seek to target agricultural farms and businesses. This creates a public safety concern as well as an animal welfare concern as OSHA intends to publish the addresses of farm businesses, which routinely produce, store, and maintain highly sensitive, hazardous, or valuable products or commodities.\\n\\nUnder the prosed rule, OSHA would require that all records be submitted electronically. The agency assumes that most businesses keep electronic records and would be able to submit records electronically. However, some businesses do not have access to computers and broadband internet. In many parts of rural New York, reliable internet access remains a problem, and a rule that requires only electronic submissions does not recognize the challenges that business in rural America face. Nationally, 68 percent of farms own or lease a computer and 67 percent have internet access, but only about 40 percent of farmers actually use a computer to conduct farm business. Electronic submission would only cause undue hardship for some farmers and consideration should be given for paper submissions.  \\n\\nFor these reasons, I urge OSHA to withdraw this proposed rule. Thank you for considering these comments.',\n",

Reg. 67254. The proposed rule would require employers to electronically submit injury and illness records (300A, 300, 301) to OSHA, which would be made publically available through an online database.\\n\\nI believe exceptional jobsite safety and health practices are inherently good for business. However, the proposed rule does nothing to achieve OSHA's stated goal of reducing injuries, illnesses and fatalities, and instead will force employers to consume large amounts of time and resources on electronic reporting that could be put towards better use. \\n\\nThe proposed rule will allow OSHA to obtain and release to the public detailed information regarding specific workplace injuries and illnesses, including the company, location and incident-specific data. However, this information is not a reliable measure of my company's safety records or its efforts to promote a safe work environment. OSHA would be providing this information to the public without any meaningful context, and I'm very concerned about the data being misconstrued by the public and improper conclusions or assumptions being made about my business. This proposal could easily lead to unwarranted damage to my company's reputation and result in loss of jobs and future work.\\n\\nOSHA's proposal will require my company to submit confidential business details to the agency. This proprietary information would be disclosed to my competitors, and those aiming to threaten or disrupt the security and overall operations of my business. In addition, OSHA also asks the employer to submit sensitive personal information about my employees. Although the agency has stated that it will redact certain personal information from the public disclosures, it has also failed to adequately explain to stakeholders how it plans to accomplish the task. Even with the redaction of names, addresses, physicians, I am concerned that other information could nonetheless unfairly identify an employee. \\n\\nIn the proposal, OSHA states the information received through the mandatory electronic filing of injury and illness records could be used for enforcement efforts. This goes against decades of practice by OSHA, suggesting now that all incidents are the fault of the employer, failing to account for accidents that could be beyond an employers' control. OSHA is now attempting to shame employers into compliance by using data that fails to show the complete narrative of the company's safety record. \\n\\nFinally, OSHA has greatly underestimated the cost this rulemaking will have on businesses.  The agency has failed to account for the time spent training employees, the additional time taken by employers to determine if an injury or illness is work-related, and the costs included with implementing an electronic recordkeeping system. Before the agency moves forward, it must go back and review the costs associated with the proposal. \\n\\nFor all the reasons outlined above, I urge OSHA to withdraw this proposal.  \\n\\nThank you for the opportunity to submit comments on this matter.\",\n",

       "  'After review, we challenge OSHA\\'s contention that the proposed new method of tracking injuries and illnesses would lead to improvements in workplace safety, improvements in occupational safety and health research and improvements in OSHA compliance.  Of those three contentions, the only valid contention is a better use of enforcement efforts that could lead to better OSHA compliance.  It\\'s unrealistic to achieve improved workplace safety with a lagging indicator such as injuries and illness reports.  Safety and health research will not be improved with this new tracking system as there is already better data available.\\nThe proposed standard separates the demands for safety and illness reporting, based on size of company.  Companies with over 250 employees during the reporting year must electronically report on a quarterly basis using the OSHA 300 form, the OSHA 300A and the 301 OSHA form.  The information is planned to be provided publically on a website.  The information provided from the OSHA 300 form and the OSHA 301 form is not necessary.  In fact, providing a list of injured individuals, their injuries and a specific description of the accidents is private information and should not be provided to the public.\\n\\nCompanies with over 20 employees during the reporting year must electronically report annually using the OSHA 300A Summary Form.  This type of reporting would not be a burden on employers and would avoid \"privacy issues\", but would provide enough information for a more effective enforcement effort.\\n\\nElectronically reporting annually with the OSHA 300A Summary form would be a better use of the summary reporting.  Rather than just posting  the summary information at the jobsite, where few would view it, with a click of a button on the computer it would be sent to OSHA with a greater viewing and a greater impact on safety and health issues in industry.  This annual report would enable OSHA to better focus their enforcement efforts on firms that choose to not protect their workers.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that requiring companies with over 250 employees to electronically report on a quarterly basis all their OSHA 300, 300A and 301 forms is unnecessary and crosses the line when private information is being offered up to the public.  However, requiring all companies to provide an electronic copy of their OSHA 300A on an annual basis would perhaps better focus OSHA enforcement efforts to where it is really needed.',\n",
       "  \"OSHA proposes this regulation as a means to publicly harass employers on safety.  Yet, there is nothing about safety included in the OSHA Recordkeeping system.  So this injury/illness data will be provided to the public without any explanation of its relationship to the safety management efforts by the site or company.\\n\\nOSHA has added the recordkeeping forms to the docket.  It is my belief that the detailed parts of this medical outcomes and job placement recordkeeping system should also be included in the docket to support the view that this recordkeeping system is not about safety.\\n\\nOccupational Safety is defined by the National Safety Council in the Principles of Occupational Safety and Health Course as:  The control and elimination of recognized hazards in the workplace to attain an acceptable level of risk.\\n\\nThe basis of the OSHA Recordkeeping Requirements is from the OSHAct, which reads:\\n\\n“The Secretary shall prescribe regulations requiring employers to maintain accurate records of, and to make periodic reports on, work-related deaths, injuries and illnesses, other than minor injuries requiring only first aid treatment and which do not involve medical treatment, loss of consciousness, restriction of work or motion or transfer to another job.”  \\n\\nSo, as previously mentioned,  the OSHA Recordkeeping System is about medical outcome and job placement outcomes.\\n\\nThe relationship between the OSHA Recordkeeping Requirements and Safety exists but it is minimal.  OSHA, in a note to the Purpose of their Recordkeeping System (29 CFR 1904.0, presented in the attached document, acknowledge the absence of relationship between recordkeeping and safety.  The note states:  \\n\\nNote to § 1904.0: Recording or reporting a work-related injury, illness, or fatality does not mean that the employer or employee was at fault, that an OSHA rule has been violated, or that the employee is eligible for workers' compensation or other benefits. \\n\\nIn the attached file are the copied requirements from OSHA Standard 1904.0, 1904.4, 1904.5 and 1904.7  There are 30 sections of instructions in the standard.

PMPA member companies are committed to improving workplace safety.\\nPMPA will be represented by Miles Free, Director of Industry Research and Technology and expects our testimony to take between 10- 15 minutes.\\n\\nOur testimony will focus on the following points:\\n1)\\tOSHA has not provided any reasons to show how making this previously confidential information public will advance safety;\\n2)\\tOSHA has shown no public purpose to justify the  increase in the reporting frequency to quarterly;\\n3)\\tThe creation of quarterly reporting merely provides OSHA  with another means to find employers to be not in compliance with yet another paperwork requirement;\\n4)\\tThe proposal removes the presumption of privacy rights from the employer and employees whose data and information  would be reported;\\n5)\\tWe disagree with the presumption of this proposal that data shared for statistical and regulatory purposes  should be broadly disseminated and made publically available to third parties who have no regulatory need for that data;\\n6)\\tEmployers are mandated by the federal government to protect the privacy of health related information of employees in our records, yet OSHA will use this rule to publicize to the world the injury or illness status of our employees;\\n7)\\tBut most seriously, the way that this proposal has been explained places the credibility of OSHA on the line: telling employers that “The proposal does not add any new requirement to keep records, it only modifies an employer’s obligation to transmit these records to OSHA”  is disingenuous at best when the proposal in fact removes the privacy of the employers’ data and changes its status from confidential to publically accessible. Telling us that ‘nothing has changed,’ when in fact the agency’s intent is to remove privacy status of employer reported information and publish those details online is not telling the whole truth.\\n\\nWe agree with the President who we paraphrase here: “If we cannot trust the executive branch with our data, we’re going to have some problems.” In this proposal, OSHA’s assurances that nothing has changed- when in fact they intend to change the status of the employer data from confidential for agency use only to publically accessible- has created an issue of lack of trust. \\n\\nOSHA should not implement this rule. This rule does not advance safety, increases employer regulatory burden, and removes confidentiality of employer / employee regulatory information. \\n\\nPMPA respectfully requests that this proposed rule not be implemented, and that all data required to be reported from employers to OSHA be held to the same rights of privacy, confidentiality and professionalism in its use as it is currently.\\n\\n\\nMiles Free\\nDirector, Industry Research and Technology\\nPrecision Machined Products Association\\n6700 West Snowville Rd. \\nBrecksville Ohio 44141\\n',\n",

These comments address the privacy risks associated with the proposed public disclosure of such records. Our perspective is informed by substantial advances in privacy science that have been made in the computer science literature and by recent research conducted by the members of the Privacy Tools for Sharing Research Data project at Harvard University.\\n\\nTwelve pages of detailed comments are attached. \\n(They are also available here: http://drmaltman.wordpress.com/2014/03/08/how-to-provide-public-transparency-with-individual-privacy-comments-to-osha/ )\\n\\nTo briefly summarize. We argue that workplace injury and illness records should be made more widely available because releasing these data has substantial potential individual, research, policy, and economic benefits. However, OSHA has a responsibility to apply best practices to manage data privacy and mitigate potential harms to individuals that might arise from data release.\\n\\nThe complexity, detail, richness, and emerging uses for data create significant uncertainties about the ability of traditional ‘anonymization’ and redaction methods and standards alone to protect the confidentiality of individuals.

Work safety and the health of my family and my employees is a top priority for my family farm and something we focus on every day in New York.\\n\\nI have some serious concerns about this rule related to privacy and safety, and I urge OSHA to withdraw this prosed regulation.\\n\\nThe proposed rule would require employers to electronically submit injury and illness information currently in the 300A, 300, 301 Forms to OSHA. Employers with 20 or more employees would have to report annually with no paper options. The agency also would have discretion under the proposal to require any employer to submit more detailed information about specific injuries and illnesses. A major concern is that fact that OSHA has not been able to justify its reasoning for how this data will be used.\\n\\nOSHA intends to provide public online access to the injury and illness records so the public, including employers, employees, potential employees, researchers, consumers, and labor organizations and businesses will have full accessibility to this data. Currently, farmers are required to complete injury information for OSHA’s use, however, the information is not generally available to the public and is available only to researchers on a basis consistent with confidential data. The injury data will be released without proper context relating to how or why an accident occurred. Without the proper context, the data will not be reflected as a reliable measure of an employer’s safety records or its efforts to promote a safe work environment. This could lead to misinterpretation of data and false assumptions and conclusions about an employer. It presents the opportunity for interest groups to mischaracterize and misuse information for topics unrelated to safety.\\n\\nAllowing private information such as the company name, location, home addresses, home contact information, and incident-specific data to become public information raises privacy concerns for farmers. Since many farmers live where they work, this creates a direct threat. Not only could this affect the safety of the employer but that of family members and employees. The data may be used for unintended purposes by those who seek to target agricultural farms and businesses. This creates a public safety concern as well as an animal welfare concern as OSHA intends to publish the addresses of farm businesses, which routinely produce, store, and maintain highly sensitive, hazardous, or valuable products or commodities.\\n\\nUnder the prosed rule, OSHA would require that all records be submitted electronically. The agency assumes that most businesses keep electronic records and would be able to submit records electronically. However, some businesses do not have access to computers and broadband internet. In many parts of rural New York, reliable internet access remains a problem, and a rule that requires only electronic submissions does not recognize the challenges that business in rural America face. Nationally, 68 percent of farms own or lease a computer and 67 percent have internet access, but only about 40 percent of farmers actually use a computer to conduct farm business. Electronic submission would only cause undue hardship for some farmers and consideration should be given for paper submissions.  \\n\\nFor these reasons, I urge OSHA to withdraw this proposed rule. Thank you for considering these comments.',\n",

The CCNJ represents over 70 companies involved in the business of chemistry (pharmaceuticals, chemicals, flavors and fragrances, petroleum refining, etc.) in New Jersey.  The business of chemistry directly employs over 50,000 persons in New Jersey and is responsible for over $25 billion dollars in revenues in New Jersey each year.   The CCNJ members place high value and priority on safety and security for their employees and in their workplace.  The CCNJ is committed to improved environmental, health, safety and security performance through the American Chemistry Council’s (ACC) Responsible Care Program, common sense advocacy designed to address major public policy issues and health and environmental research and product testing.  \\n\\nThe chemical industry is committed to the goals of zero injuries, zero incidents, and no harm to the environment and places high value and priority on creating a safe and secure work environment for our employees.  Based upon ACC data, we have achieved an aggregate worker injury and illness rate of 0.75 per 100 full time employees (FTEs) in 2012.  This is five times better than the average for all of US manufacturing. \\n\\n CCNJ supports OSHA’s goal of improving worker health and safety. However, we strongly urge OSHA to reconsider this proposed rule, as it raises many concerns for CCNJ and its members.  As more fully explained below, these issues and concerns include the following:\\n\\n•\\tThe reported information is not a reliable measure of an employer’s safety record and could be misconstrued and misused causing misallocation of resources\\n\\n•\\tPosting of sensitive information by employer, location, and injury-specific data raises business confidentiality and employee privacy concerns \\n\\n•\\tThe proposed rule abandons OSHA’s “No-fault” approach to recordkeeping without justification or analysis \\n\\n•\\tThe proposed rule creates disincentives to reporting\\n\\n•\\tThe proposed rule overestimates benefits and underestimates costs\\n\\nOSHA’s Notice of Proposed Rule Making does not provide the rigorous basis needed to demonstrate that the agency would achieve its stated goal of reducing injuries, illnesses and fatalities. Moreover, the proposal would force employers to disclose sensitive information to the public that could easily be manipulated, mischaracterized, and misused for reasons wholly unrelated to safety, and subject employers to illegitimate attacks and employees to violations of their privacy.  In addition, the proposal would reverse the long-standing, “no-fault” approach to recordkeeping, and reduce employers’ incentive to record questionable injuries. Finally, OSHA failed to account for the total costs its rulemaking would impose on businesses, while citing vast benefits without proper support for such claims. Indeed, significant agency resources would be consumed as well.\\n \\nTherefore, the Chemistry Council of New Jersey encourages OSHA to consider the fundamental concerns outlined above as the agency proceeds with the next step in the rulemaking process. \\n\\nAgain, thank you for accepting and considering our input at this time in the process.  If you should have questions about our input, please contact me by phone at (609) 392-4214 or by e-mail at schranowski@chemistrycouncilnj.org.\\n\\nBest Regards,\\n\\n\\nSteve Chranowski\\nChemistry Council of New Jersey\\nDirector of Regulatory Affairs\\n150 West State Street\\nTrenton, New Jersey 08608\\n\\nThis is an excerpt of the letter attached.

Reg. 67254. The proposed rule would require employers to electronically submit injury and illness records (300A, 300, 301) to OSHA, which would be made publically available through an online database.\\n\\nI believe exceptional jobsite safety and health practices are inherently good for business. However, the proposed rule does nothing to achieve OSHA's stated goal of reducing injuries, illnesses and fatalities, and instead will force employers to consume large amounts of time and resources on electronic reporting that could be put towards better use. \\n\\nThe proposed rule will allow OSHA to obtain and release to the public detailed information regarding specific workplace injuries and illnesses, including the company, location and incident-specific data. However, this information is not a reliable measure of my company's safety records or its efforts to promote a safe work environment. OSHA would be providing this information to the public without any meaningful context, and I'm very concerned about the data being misconstrued by the public and improper conclusions or assumptions being made about my business. This proposal could easily lead to unwarranted damage to my company's reputation and result in loss of jobs and future work.\\n\\nOSHA's proposal will require my company to submit confidential business details to the agency. This proprietary information would be disclosed to my competitors, and those aiming to threaten or disrupt the security and overall operations of my business. In addition, OSHA also asks the employer to submit sensitive personal information about my employees. Although the agency has stated that it will redact certain personal information from the public disclosures, it has also failed to adequately explain to stakeholders how it plans to accomplish the task. Even with the redaction of names, addresses, physicians, I am concerned that other information could nonetheless unfairly identify an employee. \\n\\nIn the proposal, OSHA states the information received through the mandatory electronic filing of injury and illness records could be used for enforcement efforts. This goes against decades of practice by OSHA, suggesting now that all incidents are the fault of the employer, failing to account for accidents that could be beyond an employers' control. OSHA is now attempting to shame employers into compliance by using data that fails to show the complete narrative of the company's safety record. \\n\\nFinally, OSHA has greatly underestimated the cost this rulemaking will have on businesses.  The agency has failed to account for the time spent training employees, the additional time taken by employers to determine if an injury or illness is work-related, and the costs included with implementing an electronic recordkeeping system. Before the agency moves forward, it must go back and review the costs associated with the proposal. \\n\\nFor all the reasons outlined above, I urge OSHA to withdraw this proposal.  \\n\\nThank you for the opportunity to submit comments on this matter.\",\n",

       "  'March 3, 2014\\nRE: OSHA’s Proposed Improvements to Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses \\nOSHA Docket No. 2013-0023 and 2010-0024\\nDear Colleague,\\nAs the corporate safety manager of a 2,000 employee global engineering consulting firm specializing in the built environment, I am writing to express my concern about the proposed changes to OSHA’s tracking of workplace injuries and illnesses. Safety professionals in the engineering and construction industry would have a difficult time complying with the regulations as they are proposed.\\n1)\\tFor firms in our industry, permanent work locations for individuals change from year to year. At any given time, our firm is engaged in hundreds of active projects. Some of these jobs lead to new permanent work locations for a short period of time while construction and engineering work is being carried out at a job site. In many cases we do not know in advance if the site will exist for longer than a year, creating a significant challenge in identifying which of these sites would require quarterly reporting under the revised regulation. \\n2)\\tWhile some multi-establishment enterprises track time independently for each establishment, our centralized electronic timekeeping tool is used to track hours at multiple locations (~56 office locations in the U.S.). A quarterly reporting requirement would require tracking each employee’s time and providing a breakdown of hours for each location where he or she works.  Many employees work at multiple locations, including construction site locations, that meet the requirements for permanent establishments.  For example, in 2013, while we had 56 office locations, there were an additional 45 construction offices related to specific projects that met the criteria for permanent establishments. OSHA logs were developed for each of those construction offices.  Currently, our corporate safety group compiles all of the information required for reporting, including the number of hours worked at each permanent establishment, on an annual basis.  The burden to evaluate data on a location by location basis quarterly will be significantly greater, as discussed in more detail in item 3 below.  In addition, time keeping reported on a quarterly basis will be more susceptible to errors and could require addendums and corrections throughout the year. \\n3)\\tThe proposed rulemaking provided an estimate of the time required for compliance of about 30 minutes per establishment.  We believe that OSHA’s estimate is unrealistic as applied to our firm and others in our industry.  Based on my calculations, if the proposed reporting requirements are implemented, it would take my two-person staff two weeks of full-time work every quarter to comply, and would also require input from our technical staff. That would be more than 160 person hours, four times per year.  We believe that this intensive effort is not in alignment with the goals of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.\\nAs safety professionals, we measure the success of programs using leading and lagging indicators. Leading indicators are statistics such as quantity of employees trained, number of observations conducted, and the number of safety audits completed. Lagging indicators relate to injury and illness data. Our safety program focuses on leading indicators to move our program forward and keep our employees safe. It is clear to us that the proposed regulation will take safety staff time away from fulfilling our mission of working safely and preventing workplace injuries. \\nIt is my recommendation that rather than moving forward with the extensive changes noted in OSHA Docket No. 2013-0023 and 2010-0024, that OSHA adopt the changes as noted in Alternative B for Annual Submission under Proposed Sec.  1904.41(a)(1).\\nThank you for the opportunity to comment on these proposed changes. If I can provide further information, please contact me.\\nSincerely,\\n\\nPaula J. Loht, CIH, CSP\\nCorporate Safety Manager\\nGannett Fleming, Inc.\\n',\n",

       "  'I am in favor of this change.  Gathering safety information on prospective business partners is difficult and we could use this information.  Our employees typically work under the supervision of our business partners and the OSHA 300 Log can help us determine whether a company will provide a safe work environment for our employees.  Many firms will not share OSHA log information, which makes us less able to screen for safety minded business partners.  It is also likely many firms do not accurately record injuries, especially regarding temporary employees.  Knowing that the 300 Log information is available to the public and other interested parties, such as employees, this rule change will go a long way towards encouraging employers to maintain more accurate records.  Thank you.',\n",

       "  'RE:      Docket No. OSHA-2013-0023, Proposed Rule to Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses\\n\\nTo Whom It May Concern:\\n\\nI appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to establish improvements for tracking of workplace injuries and illnesses. Work safety and the health of my family and my employees is a top priority for my family farm and something we focus on every day in New York.\\n\\nI have some serious concerns about this rule related to privacy and safety, and I urge OSHA to withdraw this proposed regulation.\\n\\nThe proposed rule would require employers to electronically submit injury and illness information currently in the 300A, 300, 301 Forms to OSHA. Employers with 20 or more employees would have to report annually with no paper options. The agency also would have discretion under the proposal to require any employer to submit more detailed information about specific injuries and illnesses. A major concern is that fact that OSHA has not been able to justify its reasoning for how this data will be used.\\n\\nOSHA intends to provide public online access to the injury and illness records so the public, including employers, employees, potential employees, researchers, consumers, and labor organizations and businesses will have full accessibility to this data. Currently, farmers are required to complete injury information for OSHA’s use, however, the information is not generally available to the public and is available only to researchers on a basis consistent with confidential data. The injury data will be released without proper context relating to how or why an accident occurred. Without the proper context, the data will not be reflected as a reliable measure of an employer’s safety records or its efforts to promote a safe work environment. This could lead to misinterpretation of data and false assumptions and conclusions about an employer. It presents the opportunity for interest groups to mischaracterize and misuse information for topics unrelated to safety.\\n\\nAllowing private information such as the company name, location, home addresses, home contact information, and incident-specific data to become public information raises privacy concerns for farmers. Since many farmers live where they work, this creates a direct threat. Not only could this affect the safety of the employer but that of family members and employees. The data may be used for unintended purposes by those who seek to target agricultural farms and businesses. This creates a public safety concern as well as an animal welfare concern as OSHA intends to publish the addresses of farm businesses, which routinely produce, store, and maintain highly sensitive, hazardous, or valuable products or commodities.\\n\\nUnder the proposed rule, OSHA would require that all records be submitted electronically. The agency assumes that most businesses keep electronic records and would be able to submit records electronically. However, some businesses do not have access to computers and broadband internet. In many parts of rural New York, reliable internet access remains a problem, and a rule that requires only electronic submissions does not recognize the challenges that business in rural America face. Nationally, 68 percent of farms own or lease a computer and 67 percent have internet access, but only about 40 percent of farmers actually use a computer to conduct farm business. Electronic submission would only cause undue hardship for some farmers and consideration should be given for paper submissions.  \\n\\nFor these reasons, I urge OSHA to withdraw this proposed rule. Thank you for considering these comments.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nJohn Gibbs',\n",

However, the proposed rule does nothing to achieve OSHA's stated goal of reducing injuries, illnesses and fatalities, and instead will force employers to consume large amounts of time and resources on electronic reporting that could be put towards better use. \\n\\nThe proposed rule will allow OSHA to obtain and release to the public detailed information regarding specific workplace injuries and illnesses, including the company, location and incident-specific data.

       "  'This proposal will not help an employer create a safer work place, particularly the part of posting accidents for public access. How would it? What it will do is create and escalate an environment of manufacturers are \"bad\" and must be continually monitored to make sure they do nothing wrong. How about we do something that encourages accomplishments instead of trying to demean companies when they have one accident by putting it out there for the world to see and a plethora of media, competitors, unions and lawyers to do with as they wish? Are you going to post for public viewing how many days we go without an accident or how many months go by without any lost time injuries or who wins our safety contest or how much we invest in our business to create a safe work environment, OR are you only going to post for public viewing the \"bad\" that occurs so USA manufacturers can continue to be labeled as the \"bad\" guys?

       "  'The late Senator George McGovern wrote in a 1992 Wall Street Journal column, “… I also wish that during the years I was in public office, I had had this firsthand experience about the difficulties business people face every day. That knowledge would have made me a better U.S. senator …. We intuitively know that to create job opportunities we need entrepreneurs who will risk their capital against an expected payoff. Too often, however, public policy does not consider whether we are choking off those opportunities.” \\nThe US Department of Labor proposal to change OSHA workplace reporting of injury and illness data to be electronically posted on a special web site has the potential of “choking off” opportunities.  As Commissioner of Labor, duly elected by the citizens of Oklahoma, I have a lawful obligation to speak out for the economic well-being as well as safety concerns of the citizens of this great state.  I strongly oppose this rule change as the proposal seems to be more about politics rather than public safety policy.\\nThe experimental idea of OSHA using “naming and shaming” as a means to improve safety is unwise. The unintended consequences are likely to do more harm than good. It’s the functional equivalent of painting a scarlet letter on individual businesses while creating a pick list for trial lawyers nationwide.\\nThe dearth of private sector appointees in the Obama administration is evident in this proposal. There is no evidence that the bureaucrats who promulgated such rules have ever started, owned, or operated a business as did McGovern after he left the Senate.\\nThis proposed regulation is a federal government overreach that will invite distortion of a company’s safety record and encourage unions, trial lawyers, and other adversaries of the marketplace to use the data against the backbone of the economy, American businesses.  The proposed use of data does not tell the full story about the circumstances surrounding an injury and efforts to prevent such injury by the business owner.\\nAs President Ronald Reagan once joked, “I’m from the government, I’m here to help.” This dubious proposal and its’ hostility towards the private sector is no joke.  I call for a stand-down on this proposal.\\n\\n \\nMark Costello\\nCommissioner of Labor\\nState of Oklahoma',\n",

Reg. 67254. The proposed rule would require employers to electronically submit injury and illness records (300A, 300, 301) to OSHA, which would be made publically available through an online database.\\n\\nI believe exceptional jobsite safety and health practices are inherently good for business. However, the proposed rule does nothing to achieve OSHA's stated goal of reducing injuries, illnesses and fatalities, and instead will force employers to consume large amounts of time and resources on electronic reporting that could be put towards better use. \\n\\nThe proposed rule will allow OSHA to obtain and release to the public detailed information regarding specific workplace injuries and illnesses, including the company, location and incident-specific data. However, this information is not a reliable measure of my company's safety records or its efforts to promote a safe work environment. OSHA would be providing this information to the public without any meaningful context, and I'm very concerned about the data being misconstrued by the public and improper conclusions or assumptions being made about my business. This proposal could easily lead to unwarranted damage to my company's reputation and result in loss of jobs and future work.\\n\\nOSHA's proposal will require my company to submit confidential business details to the agency. This proprietary information would be disclosed to my competitors, and those aiming to threaten or disrupt the security and overall operations of my business. In addition, OSHA also asks the employer to submit sensitive personal information about my employees. Although the agency has stated that it will redact certain personal information from the public disclosures, it has also failed to adequately explain to stakeholders how it plans to accomplish the task. Even with the redaction of names, addresses, physicians, I am concerned that other information could nonetheless unfairly identify an employee. \\n\\nIn the proposal, OSHA states the information received through the mandatory electronic filing of injury and illness records could be used for enforcement efforts. This goes against decades of practice by OSHA, suggesting now that all incidents are the fault of the employer, failing to account for accidents that could be beyond an employers' control. OSHA is now attempting to shame employers into compliance by using data that fails to show the complete narrative of the company's safety record. \\n\\nFinally, OSHA has greatly underestimated the cost this rulemaking will have on businesses.  The agency has failed to account for the time spent training employees, the additional time taken by employers to determine if an injury or illness is work-related, and the costs included with implementing an electronic recordkeeping system. Before the agency moves forward, it must go back and review the costs associated with the proposal. \\n\\nFor all the reasons outlined above, I urge OSHA to withdraw this proposal.  \\n\\nThank you for the opportunity to submit comments on this matter.\",\n",

       "  \"Please stop OSHA's proposed rule to require business to submit electronic reporting of injuries. This is another intrusion to American business.  The information sought is required to be reported by insurance companies and the BLS already collects/collates data. Despite OSHA's current viewpoint, the majority of America's employers are providing safe workplaces and do care about the health and safety of its workers.  It is feared among many industries that some employers will discourage reporting of injuries by employees because the proposed public reporting could have an economic impact on a company's ability to be considered for work. This will not only be a detriment to the employee but also to America's business.\",\n",

       "  'Our Company is opposed to the proposed rule basically the \"naming and shaming\" as a means to improve safety is unwise.  The accidents that we have had in our facility over the last few years are ALL based on employee\\'s making a bad decision, they have been trained, disciplined when needed, and trained some more; but sometimes they still do not follow what they have been taught and a Company should not be named/shamed for the bad decision an employee makes. We provide our employees with a safe place to work as stated above they receive safety training and on the job training.  Our supervisors follow up to ensure they know how to perform their job safely and efficiently.  If someone should be named and shamed it should be the employee who does not follow Company Safety Rules/Policy/Procedures and not the Company.  ',\n",

       "  'On behalf of the more than 140,000 members of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), I am pleased to submit the attached comments on the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses that was published in the Federal Register on November 8, 2013 (78 Fed. Reg. 67254-67283) (Electronic Recordkeeping NPRM).  As an interested stakeholder in this regulatory activity, NAHB is concerned that OSHA’s proposed changes to the recordkeeping rule to add requirements for the electronic submission of injury and illness information will have a substantial adverse impact on regulated employers and small businesses, including home builders and specialty trade contractors.\\n\\nSee attached comment letter.',\n",
       "  \"As an employer, I am fine with having all OSHA forms be reported quarterly in an electronic format. However, I don't feel that it is effective or fair to publish results publically.  In many cases, good hard working companies spend thousands of dollars training employees to perform actions safely.  However, not all employees follow all the rules and get injured.  If such injuries are published then it falsly gives the impression that an employer is not doing everything they can to prevent an injury.  \\n\\nTo me, it seems like we are not being fair to companies.  Why can't employers see a database that contains the reasons why emloyees have been terminated from their previous employers.  We could make better decision when hiring people.  Such a database is deemed illegal but a database of injuries that are not always the fault of the employer is ok to have?\\n\\nI really think that there needs to be some thought put into why this data is made public.  It will really not help because in many cases it is not the fault of an employer that an employee doesn't follow the training or the requirements.\",\n",

Reg. 67254. The proposed rule would require employers to electronically submit injury and illness records (300A, 300, 301) to OSHA, which would be made publically available through an online database.\\n\\nI believe exceptional jobsite safety and health practices are inherently good for business. However, the proposed rule does nothing to achieve OSHA's stated goal of reducing injuries, illnesses and fatalities, and instead will force employers to consume large amounts of time and resources on electronic reporting that could be put towards better use. \\n\\nThe proposed rule will allow OSHA to obtain and release to the public detailed information regarding specific workplace injuries and illnesses, including the company, location and incident-specific data. However, this information is not a reliable measure of my company's safety records or its efforts to promote a safe work environment. OSHA would be providing this information to the public without any meaningful context, and I'm very concerned about the data being misconstrued by the public and improper conclusions or assumptions being made about my business. This proposal could easily lead to unwarranted damage to my company's reputation and result in loss of jobs and future work.\\n\\nOSHA's proposal will require my company to submit confidential business details to the agency. This proprietary information would be disclosed to my competitors, and those aiming to threaten or disrupt the security and overall operations of my business. In addition, OSHA also asks the employer to submit sensitive personal information about my employees. Although the agency has stated that it will redact certain personal information from the public disclosures, it has also failed to adequately explain to stakeholders how it plans to accomplish the task. Even with the redaction of names, addresses, physicians, I am concerned that other information could nonetheless unfairly identify an employee. \\n\\nIn the proposal, OSHA states the information received through the mandatory electronic filing of injury and illness records could be used for enforcement efforts. This goes against decades of practice by OSHA, suggesting now that all incidents are the fault of the employer, failing to account for accidents that could be beyond an employers' control. OSHA is now attempting to shame employers into compliance by using data that fails to show the complete narrative of the company's safety record. \\n\\nFinally, OSHA has greatly underestimated the cost this rulemaking will have on businesses.  The agency has failed to account for the time spent training employees, the additional time taken by employers to determine if an injury or illness is work-related, and the costs included with implementing an electronic recordkeeping system. Before the agency moves forward, it must go back and review the costs associated with the proposal. \\n\\nFor all the reasons outlined above, I urge OSHA to withdraw this proposal.  \\n\\nThank you for the opportunity to submit comments on this matter.\",\n",

       "  'Commenters to this docket have compared the injury/illness record keeping to environmental data.  And, therefore, publishing it to activists and from them to the public is an act of transparency. Wrong!  The two data sets are not comparable, at all.    Publishing injury/illness data as defined by the OSHA Act and the ponderous OSHA regulations from it is not transparency for safety.\\n\\nEnvironmental regulations are extensive, prescriptive and, most of all, generally predictive, technically.  That is, they are designed to produce defined, predictable outcomes.  So if a site’s environmental results are out of an acceptable range, a conclusion can be that the site is out of compliance with the regulations.  That is a logical conclusion until data can be examined, due to the technical design and predictability of Environmental regulations. \\n\\nOSHA injury/illness data do not reliably predict anything.  It is not a technical predictor of regulatory compliance or of good or bad safety management.  It is, instead, a logging system for thousands of medical outcomes.  So drawing conclusions about either compliance or safety management from OSHA data is completely wrong.\\n\\nAccording to the National Safety Council’s Course Manual for Team Safety: “Occupational Safety and Health results from a continuous proactive process of anticipating, identifying, designing, implementing and evaluating risk-reduction practices.”  So how does this ponderous, overly complicated OSHA injury/illness record keeping system predict or measure risk or risk reduction?  It does not!  It is just all ugly political agenda.\\n\\nOSHA safety regulations are, indeed, predicated on injuries that have occurred from particular hazards.  For example, employees, historically, have been seriously injured from equipment being inadvertently started up while they were maintaining it.  So OHSA has implemented a lockout/tagout regulation.  And, if, for example, employees are being injured while maintaining equipment that has not been locked out in violation of the standard, then the data will show that.  But the injury/illness data also includes all other injuries, none of which may be related to any regulation on the books or that could even be put in place.  The data also includes injuries/illnesses that are not responsive to the safety management system as well as injuries/illnesses that had their origins in non-work related situations but manifested themselves at the work site.\\n\\nSo the idea that OSHA injury/illness data are useful for comparisons between operations or companies or is an appropriate indicator for whether a company is paying suitable attention to the safety of their employees or is in compliance with OSHA regulations is preposterous.\\n\\nAnother problem this regulation is supposed to fix is that OSHA does not receive timely data on injuries and illnesses.  Really?  What is OSHA going to do with it if they had it?  Write more standards?  Show up for an inspection because a site has a transitory increase in injuries/illnesses or a small site has an injury/illness rate because of the math of the rate calculation?   If OSHA receives this data pointed out in public by the activists and they don’t show up NOW to inspect those sites, the activists and their Congressional colleagues will be all over that.  \\n\\nAnd OSHA has recently said in their defense of their VPP program to the DOL OIG that immediate data or year to date data is not typically indicative of a site’s compliance or safety program efforts.  Even OSHA knows that their data is not a good predictor of employer compliance or safety management.  Yet, OSHA, in this proposed regulation, talks out of the other side of their mouth about this data.  Why?  Their political agenda.\\n\\nI mentioned this in a recent post to this docket, but today, March 8, 2014 I am reading the 22 posts of this morning.  And I am reminded again that the persons and organizations who support this terrible proposed regulation are NOT the people who do recordkeeping.  I doubt most of them would recognize a work related injury or illness if they saw it—or even know what to do about it.\\n\\nThese advocates of this regulation want us (not them) to compare the data and use it in some glorious, collaborative, kum ba yah fashion to learn from each other.  Those of us who have to live in the real world of safety, know that this OSHA data system predicts nothing about safety and is not comparable from site to site or company or company.  So why would we want to waste our time and energy with that comparison?  Furthermore, why should we have to defend our safety management systems and our companies from these activists who do?\\n\\nAnd the persons who will have to defend site safety management systems and be adversely affected by this regulation are my safety professional colleagues.  Frankly, I resent OSHA proposing to impose on these dedicated professionals this crude, political agenda driven regulation.\\n\\nThomas W. Lawrence, Jr. CSP, P.E.\\n',\n",

       "  'Thank you for the proposed improvements in data access regarding industrial injuries.  My career has been spent as a business process analyst helping companies to improve quality. Sharing data widely to all stakeholders is a key strategy in achieving quality improvements.  In the area of industrial injuries, everyone in the workplace today could potentially benefit from the data collected and submitted to OSHA.  \\nI have further observations in two areas:  1- preventive activities data; 2- contract workers.\\nPreventive Data\\nIn addition to capturing injury data, it might also be useful to compare and contrast companies’ use of injury avoidance techniques as reflected in their training efforts, equipment modifications for disabled workers, and/or employee re-assignments.  \\nI have seen the spectrum of corporate behavior vis-à-vis safety and injury avoidance.  I worked for one company which made accommodation to an employee only after an injury; a company which made no changes for a worker’s needs, despite clear harm from a physical environment; and a company which proactively measured and changed the workstation to best suit an employee’s physical needs, while also providing training on equipment and procedures (periodic stretch breaks, etc.) reducing discomfort for the employee and minimizing disruption to work.\\nIf OSHA were to collect and re-distribute specific data on prevention strategies such as these, I believe it would be helpful to many employers in validating the need for active management of workplace safety.  Better education overall could lead both to sharing of best practices as well as insights on the effectiveness of specific preventive techniques. \\nContract Workers\\nI perceive that a gap exists in today’s workplace in regards to the safety of contract workers in some industrial and professional environments.\\nDepending on the policies of the client company as well as that of the hiring (often a temporary labor) firm, contract workers are potentially at great risk of injury in the workplace.   Many client companies seek to shield themselves from legal responsibility for contract workers, which leads to those workers not participating in individual training and equipment changes/customization provided with a new assignment.  The legally responsible hiring firm is a temporary service  or employment agency, often a bare-bones, high-profit driven entity with little interest or motivation in ergonomics and worker safety.  \\nThus, the contract worker can end up in ergonomic limbo, “on his or her own.” \\nAt the outset, the length of the assignment is often said to be not known, or is stated to be of short duration.  Potential harm to the contractor is downplayed. But “short-term” and unknown assignment durations frequently became long-term gigs, and with no permanent space assignments available, contract workers are given the worst spaces and pieces of equipment to work in and on.\\nIn some settings, contractors are sometimes specifically asked to do the heaviest labor or most dangerous jobs.  In a downsized workplace where secretaries are a thing of the past, contractors can be asked to do much of a manager’s or a work unit’s administrative work, sometimes in addition to a significant workload of analysis, meeting minutes, and spreadsheets from an existing contract assignment.  When managers are preparing for meetings or conference calls, contract workers can become today’s office assistant, preparing handouts, setting-up audio-visual equipment, ordering catering, and hauling all-of-the-above from production and storage areas to meetings.\\nFurther, since contract workers are frequently hired for specialized skills, there is seldom opportunity for work reassignment, should there arise physical challenges for the contractor in the new assignment.  \\nTemporary labor firms should be asked to properly train and equip all workers for all assignments, and keep records on the training and supply approach for each contract for each client corporations.  They should also keep injury records just as their client corporations do. These records should be preserved and submitted to OSHA’s website for all to see, even when a worker submits injury information after a contract is terminated.\\nIt is my opinion that there are many contractors working under sub-optimal conditions.  Due to these conditions, contract workers are more likely to suffer injuries on the job. They therefore need availability of the same good, public records as their colleagues at client companies.',\n",

       "  \"On December 16, 2013, the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Dept. of Labor issued a report of, I think, the third, exhaustive investigation of the VPP Program in this administration.  Taxpayers paid for seven (7) investigators for this project.  And, as in the previous investigations, they found little.\\n\\nOSHA's response is part of the report (Appendix D).  Some of OSHA's response comments relative to injury/illness data at VPP sites seems relative to this Electronic Tracking proposed regulation.  Here is a copy of part of OSHA's response:\\n\\nOSHA disagrees with a central statistic presented in the report. OIG repeatedly states that 13 percent of sites did not have systems that fully protected employees' safety and health. This includes 4 percent that were cited for serious violations and 9 percent with injury and illness rates above their respective industry averages. The vast majority of sites were addressed in accordance with OSHA policy. As a result, we believe that OIG's statement about these sites is misleading because it is based on the questionable assumption that OSHA policy does not fully protect workers.\\n\\n First, by issuing VPP Memo# 7 in May 2013, OSHA has addressed the 4 percent of sites that were cited for serious violations of OSHA standards. VPP Memo #7 eliminates the referenced variation in agency action following enforcement activity that was allowable under its previous policy. \\n\\nSecond, with regard to the remaining 9 percent, OSHA takes issue with OIG's presumption that simply having average injury and illness rates above industry rates, whether for two or three years, results in VPP participant programs that are not fully protective.\\n\\n OSHA does not believe that every participant that exceeds the industry average is necessarily failing to fully protect its workers. OSHA provided its reasoning tor using the 3-year average, which is included in the report. \\n\\nNote 1.  OSHA believes that given the sensitivity and variation of injury and illness rates, especially for small businesses, it is better to average rates over a specified timeframe and provide companies a designated period to correct conditions leading to higher rates. \\n\\nOSHA policy provides an opportunity for employers with higher rates to address these instances through the rate reduction plan.\\n\\nFurthermore, injury and illness rates are only one of many factors that OSHA evaluates during the approval and reapproval processes, and when reviewing the annual evaluations. \\n\\nNote 2. VPP sites have programs and procedures in place that promote employee involvement and assure notification of hazards and issues in the workplace. While we agree that generally this should lead to rates that are lower than industry averages, this may not always be the case. In addition, injury and illness rates are lagging indicators that provide only a partial impression of an overall program. As a result, we do not agree that the review of injury and illness rates alone provides enough data to support OIG's conclusion that participants with higher than industry average injury and illness rates do not have systems that fully protect employees.\\n\\n OIG may disagree with OSHA's policies, and we will review the policies, but OSHA does not believe that it is clear that the current policy necessarily results in the retention of VPP participants that do not provide a fully protective workplace. \\n\\nFor emphasis, I have broken out two portions of this part of OSHA's response--labeled Note 1. and Note 2.  Observe in these portions how OSHA explains that short term injury/illness data is not useful in reflecting on a site's or company's overall safety efforts.  Yet, this proposed regulation intends to use year-to-date data to depict employers as failing in their safety responsibilities to their employees.\\n\\nAnd of course, the safety and health efforts at VPP sites, many of which have more than 250 employees, will also be mischaracterized by the proposed regulation. So why is OSHA pursuing this.  \\n\\nEven though this has been on the regulatory agenda for awhile, why did it suddenly move forward with no discussion from OSHA?  Why did it require a cameo appearance by Paul O'Neill as a shill for OSHA?Tho\\n\\nIt makes for suspicion that this proposed regulation is, in reality, just a front to empower anti-VPP advocacy group colleagues of the OSHA administration to attack VPP publicly, while OSHA can righteously point to their defense of VPP in the OIG report.  Pure political agenda--which is what this proposed regulation is all about.  It is not about safety and OSHA should withdraw it.\\n\\nThomas W. Lawrence, Jr.,  CSP, P.E.\\n\",\n",

Reg. 67254. The proposed rule would require employers to electronically submit injury and illness records (300A, 300, 301) to OSHA, which would be made publically available through an online database.\\n\\nI believe exceptional jobsite safety and health practices are inherently good for business. However, the proposed rule does nothing to achieve OSHA's stated goal of reducing injuries, illnesses and fatalities, and instead will force employers to consume large amounts of time and resources on electronic reporting that could be put towards better use. \\n\\nThe proposed rule will allow OSHA to obtain and release to the public detailed information regarding specific workplace injuries and illnesses, including the company, location and incident-specific data. However, this information is not a reliable measure of my company's safety records or its efforts to promote a safe work environment. OSHA would be providing this information to the public without any meaningful context, and I'm very concerned about the data being misconstrued by the public and improper conclusions or assumptions being made about my business. This proposal could easily lead to unwarranted damage to my company's reputation and result in loss of jobs and future work.\\n\\nOSHA's proposal will require my company to submit confidential business details to the agency. This proprietary information would be disclosed to my competitors, and those aiming to threaten or disrupt the security and overall operations of my business. In addition, OSHA also asks the employer to submit sensitive personal information about my employees. Although the agency has stated that it will redact certain personal information from the public disclosures, it has also failed to adequately explain to stakeholders how it plans to accomplish the task. Even with the redaction of names, addresses, physicians, I am concerned that other information could nonetheless unfairly identify an employee. \\n\\nIn the proposal, OSHA states the information received through the mandatory electronic filing of injury and illness records could be used for enforcement efforts. This goes against decades of practice by OSHA, suggesting now that all incidents are the fault of the employer, failing to account for accidents that could be beyond an employers' control. OSHA is now attempting to shame employers into compliance by using data that fails to show the complete narrative of the company's safety record. \\n\\nFinally, OSHA has greatly underestimated the cost this rulemaking will have on businesses.

       "  \"To Whom it May Concern:\\n\\nIn response to the proposed rule to improve tracking of workplace injuries, specifically requiring that they are electronically submitted to OSHA by the employer, I'd like to add my full support.\\n\\nI am a Certified Safety Professional with numerous years in the field in both the United States and internationally. I have seen first hand failures of companies to accurately collect and maintain this data. By bringing OSHA forward into the 21st century and utilizing computer technology to easily collect this data, employers of small and medium size firms will now have to more accurately manage these records. \\n\\nIn the environmental field today, it is quite common to submit records of compliance to federal and state agencies on a periodic basis. Reports showing complacence with EPCRA, the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, and CERCLA are required on a quarterly, annual, and even monthly basis. These reports encourage employers and businesses to properly manage records, and give the governmental agencies who track them a periodic report of compliance and status of the business with respect to the regulations that apply.\\n\\nThe OSHA record keeping requirements are in place today, so companies who already would not have any undue burden. As in the environmental field, records of polluters are made available through public databases and regulatory data collection. These laws have shown not to encourage falsifying of records and underreporting, but enhanced compliance with the law and protection of workers and the environment. In the same way, these laws should benefit the workplace and the individual worker. \\n\\nI would like to put my full support behind this change as a private citizen and a safety practitioner currently employed in private industry, and appreciate the opportunity to comment.\\n\",\n",

       "  \"While discrimination has no place in our workforce, I disagree that all forms of retaliation must be avoided.  If an employee violates a safety rule, then the employer should be free to discipline or terminate depending on the offense or the rule that was broken.  Most, if not all, state workers' compensation codes provide for post-accident drug and/or alcohol testing following a reported accident.  The public policy behind this procedure is sound.  If employees are under the influence of alcohol or drugs while at work, it exposes other employees to accident and injury.  If you require an employer to retain such an employee, it exposes it to future liability.\\n\\nThe time requirement for reporting accidents/injuries/illnesses is also important because an employer needs to be able to fully investigate the employee's claims.  Most, if not all, states have time requirements that are not all that restrictive.  In Alabama, the requirement is 90 days.  There is no reason that an employee that has a valid accident or injury cannot report same within such a deadline.  Once you get beyond 90 days, the employer's ability to conduct an investigation becomes hampered because witnesses become hard to locate or remember less.  Also, the accident scene and any involved equipment may be altered.\\n\\nThe idea behind the rules is admirable but they are, for the most part, in direct conflict with most state workers' comp acts.  they need to be revised prior to going into affect in order to avoid a lot of litigation that will no doubt arise as the result of employers finding themselves in this newly created catch 22 situation.    \",\n",

       "  \"\\nMr Brown,\\nTip: Be concise but support your claims. Electronic reporting is only part of the proposed rule. Also remember that under the new rules, the following types of employer activities are expressly prohibited:\\n\\n1.\\tMandatory drug testing every time an employee reports an injury (unless there is a reason to suspect drug use). \\n\\nMy response: Mandatory drug screening allows safety professionals to conduct a more thorough investigation. It also gives the injured employee opportunity to demonstrate that illegal drug use or drug abuse is not involved. If you are innocent of illegal drugs or drug abuse this should not be an issue.\\n\\n2.\\tDemanding that employees report illnesses and injuries within a certain time after being injured or becoming ill. \\n\\nMy response: Purpose of reporting in a timely manner is to encourage reporting. This is what employers should demand. Not for the employee to hide an injury until it becomes a serious infection and not a simple first aid. We must report all injuries no matter how minor and in a timely manner.\\n\\n3.\\tRequiring employees report injuries and illnesses in-person to someone at a distant location (i.e., requiring field employees to report to someone in the office as opposed to their supervisor in the field). \\n\\nMy response: Medical treatment is already addressed in OSHA regulations.  29 CFR1910.151-General Industry, 29 CFR1910.266 Appendix A&B-Logging, 29 CFR1915.87-Shipyard etc. What is wrong with doing an investigation by a trained professional rather than someones friend or brother-in-law? \\n\\n4.\\tTerminating employees who are injured because they failed to abide by the employers safety rules. \\n\\nMy response: Certain rules are terminating offenses with or without injury. Why reward an employee for getting hurt.\\n\\n5.\\tDisciplining employees who report injuries or illnesses or terminating employees who have more than X injuries. \\n\\nMy response: Trending is an important part of accident prevention. If the variable is an unsafe worker who accepts risk then why would any intelligent employer promote at-risk behavior by not disciplining?\\n\\n6.\\tEnforcing vague safety rules like situational awareness and work carefully only after an employee is injured. \\n\\nMy response: Situational Awareness is a 50 cent term for a person not paying attention to the injury cause. Would it not be a good idea for our employees to pay attention? Working carefully is a condition of employment.\\n\\n7.\\tEnrolling employees in Repeat Offender programs. \\n\\nMy response: If an employee does not work safe and is a Repeat Offender, would it not be a better option to re-train an employee to perform the required task safely? Only other options are to 1) terminate the employee or 2) allow them to continue their unsafe actions and hurt themselves or others.\\n\\nI support my claims with over 30 years in industrial construction, 19 of those as a Construction Safety Manager, but I'm just a rookie. :-)\\n\",\n",

The proposed rule would require employers to electronically submit injury and illness records (300A, 300, 301) to OSHA, which would be made publically available through an online database.\\n\\nI believe exceptional jobsite safety and health practices are inherently good for business. However, the proposed rule does nothing to achieve OSHA's stated goal of reducing injuries, illnesses and fatalities, and instead will force employers to consume large amounts of time and resources on electronic reporting that could be put towards better use. \\n\\nThe proposed rule will allow OSHA to obtain and release to the public detailed information regarding specific workplace injuries and illnesses, including the company, location and incident-specific data. However, this information is not a reliable measure of my company's safety records or its efforts to promote a safe work environment. OSHA would be providing this information to the public without any meaningful context, and I'm very concerned about the data being misconstrued by the public and improper conclusions or assumptions being made about my business. This proposal could easily lead to unwarranted damage to my company's reputation and result in loss of jobs and future work.\\n\\nOSHA's proposal will require my company to submit confidential business details to the agency. This proprietary information would be disclosed to my competitors, and those aiming to threaten or disrupt the security and overall operations of my business. In addition, OSHA also asks the employer to submit sensitive personal information about my employees. Although the agency has stated that it will redact certain personal information from the public disclosures, it has also failed to adequately explain to stakeholders how it plans to accomplish the task. Even with the redaction of names, addresses, physicians, I am concerned that other information could nonetheless unfairly identify an employee. \\n\\nIn the proposal, OSHA states the information received through the mandatory electronic filing of injury and illness records could be used for enforcement efforts. This goes against decades of practice by OSHA, suggesting now that all incidents are the fault of the employer, failing to account for accidents that could be beyond an employers' control. OSHA is now attempting to shame employers into compliance by using data that fails to show the complete narrative of the company's safety record. \\n\\nFinally, OSHA has greatly underestimated the cost this rulemaking will have on businesses.  The agency has failed to account for the time spent training employees, the additional time taken by employers to determine if an injury or illness is work-related, and the costs included with implementing an electronic recordkeeping system. Before the agency moves forward, it must go back and review the costs associated with the proposal. \\n\\nFor all the reasons outlined above, I urge OSHA to withdraw this proposal.  \\n\\nThank you for the opportunity to submit comments on this matter.\",\n",

Contact Rob Miller at Ameren Corporation, P.O. Box 66149, St. Louis, MO  63166-6149 for additional information.\\n\\nAmeren is an investor owned electric and natural gas utility with 2.4 million electric customers and nearly 1 million natural gas customers in Missouri and Illinois.  Ameren owns a mix of nuclear, fossil and hydroelectric power plants with a capacity of 16,400 megawatts.  \\n\\nAmeren has always taken a proactive approach to employee safety and health.  Amerens commitment to protecting our employees, the public, and the environment guides our daily operations and will not be compromised in our business endeavors.  OSHAs proposed Rule on Improved Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses claims to take a positive approach in an effort of eliminating at risk conditions and events.  \\n\\nIn review of OSHAs proposed rule on Improved Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses, Ameren is requesting the following comments be given careful consideration. \\n\\n\\n5.\\tOSHA proposes Alternative B  Annual Submission.  Page 67263 of the Federal Register.\\n\\nAmeren feels that annual submission of data would eliminate any submissions not certified to be accurate from each establishment.  However, we strongly support limiting the data to that found on the 300A so as not to potentially expose any confidential information.  \\n\\n6.\\tOSHA proposes Alternative H  Narrow the Scope of the Reporting Requirements Under Proposed 1904.41(a)(1) and (2).  Page 67265 of the Federal Register.\\n\\nAmeren agrees with the idea of OSHA limiting or narrowing the scope of its focus to industries that historically have shown to have higher rates of incidence which can be rightly interpreted as those with higher risk.  The idea that utilizing this narrowed selection of industries as more or less a pilot of the new electronic reporting and the improvements made in those industries based solely on the new program we feel is plausible.  \\n\\n7.\\tOSHA proposes Alternative I  Enterprise-Wide Submission.  Page 67268 of the Federal Register.\\n\\nAmeren feels that it would be unnecessary for Parent Companies or Holding Companies to report what their subsidiaries would also be required to report.  There would be far too great a possibility of double-reporting that may bode poorly for the Parent Company.  Parent Companies in many cases do not have any employees thus would fall under the exemption status for recordkeeping.  \\n\\nRespectfully submitted,\\n\\nRobert A.

       "  \"  Sometimes some things just do not need changed.  This is one of those times.  Because someone in a position of authority feels the need to make change in something, don't try to fix what isn't broke.  Companies are open for inspection all year long. If something happens there are deadlines for it to be reported, and if too severe OSHA will be there the same day.   We track our own records daily and clearly understand that the less reported on the OSHA 300 the better, so do our utmost best to prevent accidents in the field. \\n\\n  If there is some idea that our reporting it to the BLS or OSHA directly more frequent than annually will improve our safety, that's just not true, in my opinion.  And considering the bottom line REASON for Recordkeeping is tracking of accidents and aid in prevention of repeating the same, increasing our reporting periodicity will NOT aid in that bottom line Safety of Workers.  If for example, John Employee is going to drive a hammer down onto his thumb and require a trip to the E.R., that will not be prevented because I send in more reports.  It MIGHT be prevented with more/better training, but accidents will still happen no matter how much training is held. So this increase in reporting is just a time consuming method of non-helpful monitoring.   You could probably give an example or two of a company it would benefit, but that's going to very a very small real number, of companies that need More TRAINING and Safety Monitoring, NOT more reporting.\\n\\n  I'm very impressed with the in depth statistics the BLS puts out now on the past years accidents, citations and such.  I use this data to help educate our workers on what is happening nationwide, the obvious dangers out there based off the statistics,and the comparison to ourselves.   Maybe we weren't cited for a Fall Protection the past year, but seeing it is the #1 in three categories says something about workers and employers work habits/knowledge, while also congratulating our crews for doing such a great job.    Would this help quarterly, NO.  We promote Safety year round in various ways as it is.   Companies are open for inspection all year long.

       "  'RE:      Docket No. OSHA-2013-0023\\n \\n            Proposed Rule to Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses\\n \\nTo Whom It May Concern:\\n \\nI appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to establish improvements for tracking of workplace injuries and illnesses. Work safety and the health of my family and my employees is a top priority for my family farm and something we focus on every day in New York.\\n \\nI have some serious concerns about this rule related to privacy and safety, and I urge OSHA to withdraw this prosed regulation.\\n \\nThe proposed rule would require employers to electronically submit injury and illness information currently in the 300A, 300, 301 Forms to OSHA. Employers with 20 or more employees would have to report annually with no paper options. The agency also would have discretion under the proposal to require any employer to submit more detailed information about specific injuries and illnesses. A major concern is that fact that OSHA has not been able to justify its reasoning for how this data will be used.\\n \\nOSHA intends to provide public online access to the injury and illness records so the public, including employers, employees, potential employees, researchers, consumers, and labor organizations and businesses will have full accessibility to this data. Currently, farmers are required to complete injury information for OSHA’s use, however, the information is not generally available to the public and is available only to researchers on a basis consistent with confidential data. The injury data will be released without proper context relating to how or why an accident occurred. Without the proper context, the data will not be reflected as a reliable measure of an employer’s safety records or its efforts to promote a safe work environment. This could lead to misinterpretation of data and false assumptions and conclusions about an employer. It presents the opportunity for interest groups to mischaracterize and misuse information for topics unrelated to safety.\\n \\nAllowing private information such as the company name, location, home addresses, home contact information, and incident-specific data to become public information raises privacy concerns for farmers. Since many farmers live where they work, this creates a direct threat. Not only could this affect the safety of the employer but that of family members and employees. The data may be used for unintended purposes by those who seek to target agricultural farms and businesses. This creates a public safety concern as well as an animal welfare concern as OSHA intends to publish the addresses of farm businesses, which routinely produce, store, and maintain highly sensitive, hazardous, or valuable products or commodities.\\n \\nUnder the prosed rule, OSHA would require that all records be submitted electronically. The agency assumes that most businesses keep electronic records and would be able to submit records electronically. However, some businesses do not have access to computers and broadband internet. In many parts of rural New York, reliable internet access remains a problem, and a rule that requires only electronic submissions does not recognize the challenges that business in rural America face. Nationally, 68 percent of farms own or lease a computer and 67 percent have internet access, but only about 40 percent of farmers actually use a computer to conduct farm business. Electronic submission would only cause undue hardship for some farmers and consideration should be given for paper submissions.  \\n \\nFor these reasons, I urge OSHA to withdraw this proposed rule. Thank you for considering these comments.\\n',\n",

In order to keep America’s workers safe, OSHA needs access to information about companies’ safety records in a timely manner. Further, that information must be delivered in a format that allows OSHA to efficiently analyze it for workplace hazards.\\n\\nProtecting America’s greatest asset--its workers--should be the top priority of the agency. Any rule that would make the process more efficient should be adopted.\\n\\nThank you for your consideration of my comments. Please do NOT add my name to your mailing list. I will learn about future developments on this issue from other sources.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nChristopher Lish\\nOlema, CA\",\n",

       "  'As someone in the Safety Field it is already difficult at times to encourage employees to come forward and report injuries or near misses.   It is also difficult to convince them that Employee Safety, NOT $$  is what drives a company to improve its Safety Program.  I feel that this proposed rule will send the opposite signal to companies and employees alike.   As mentioned in other comments, the number of \"recordable\" injuries does not truly indicate how safe a company is operating.\\n\\nIt is my opinion, especially after working with the consultation program, that funding would be better spent increasing programs that focus on the hazards that are present, versus the numbers of \"recordable Incidents\".   This would increase awareness, eliminate hazards and save lives.  Penalizing a company for \"Take tomorrow off\" after a pulled back, or cases where the Doctor always prescribes a prescription due to an industrial environment in no way helps encourage the management to focus on hazards BEFORE they cause an injury.  Instead this rule encourages companies to focus ONLY on the numbers or risk losing business.  \\n\\nPlease don\\'t undo the progress being made by \"leading\" safety programs and help companies stop focusing on \"lagging\" ones!',\n",

Reg. 67253, November 8, 2013).\\n\\nCEMCO Inc.is a privately held company which manufactures premier aggregate processing equipment. CEMCO Inc. employs 31 team members at our Belen, New Mexico manufacturing facility\\n\\tOur company is a member of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). The NAM has also filed comments on this proposed regulation and CEMCO Inc. fully supports the position of the NAM and incorporates those comments by reference. \\n\\n\\tFor the reasons stated below, and those addressed in the NAM’s comments, CEMCO Inc.  requests that OSHA withdraw this proposed regulation.\\n\\nDisclosure of Confidential Commercial Information and Personally Identifiable Information\\n\\nCEMCO Inc.  considers the total employee hours worked to be confidential commercial information. OSHA historically has also treated employee hours worked as confidential commercial information and has protected such information from disclosure pursuant to FOIA Exemption 4, which prohibits the release of confidential commercial information provided to the government.\\n\\n\\tWe are also troubled by the fact that the agency has provided no detailed information as to what it believes is personally identifiable information. Employees have an interest in the privacy of their medical information and simply redacting an employee’s name from the various OSHA recordkeeping forms in no way assures employees that their privacy will be protected.\\n\\n\\n\\tCEMCO Inc. is also concerned about the potential misuse of injury and illness data by third parties. While OSHA claims that the publication of raw injury and illness data will improve research in occupational safety and health, the agency cannot ignore that this information will be used by others for purposes other than safety and health. \\n\\nProviding raw data to those who do not know how to interpret it or without putting such data in context will inevitably lead to improper conclusions or assumptions about employers.  Moreover, OSHA anticipates that employees and the public will make decisions about where to work or where to do business based on these rates alone. Making such decisions based on a number without additional context will have unintended consequences, such as damage to a company’s reputation and potential loss of business and jobs.\\n\\nAdditional Concerns\\n\\nIn addition to the concerns addressed above, CEMCO Inc. believes that this proposed regulation is flawed due to the following: \\n\\n•\\tOSHA lacks statutory authority under the Occupational Safety & Health Act of 1970 (“OSH Act”) for making an employer’s raw injury and illness data available to the general public. Section 8(c)(2) provides the Secretary with authority to draft regulations requiring employers to maintain accurate records of work-related deaths, injuries and illnesses. Nothing in this section grants the Secretary the authority to publish these records to the general public.\\n\\n\\n•\\tOSHA does not provide any data, surveys, studies, or anecdotal evidence to support the alleged benefits of this proposed rule. There is no relevant data provided to support OSHA’s decision that making an employer’s injury and illness data public are necessary to carry out the agency’s statutory mandate.\\n\\n•\\tThis proposed rule will negatively impact recordkeeping. The current recordkeeping requirements established a no-fault system to encourage employers to record and employees to report injuries and illness. This proposed rule creates a disincentive for employers to properly record injuries and illnesses.\\n\\n•\\tThis proposed rule targets employers for enforcement by OSHA and “regulation by shaming” in contradiction to the stated purpose of the recordkeeping standard – that is recording a work-related injury or illness “does not mean that the employer or employee was at fault, that an OSHA rule has been violated….” 29 C.F.R. § 1904.0\\n\\n•\\tOSHA’s preliminary economic analysis is significantly flawed and we believe that OSHA has underestimated the costs of compliance with this proposed rule for employers.\\n\\nCEMCO Inc. appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on this matter. For all the reasons stated above, we urge OSHA to withdraw the proposed rule.\\n\\nRespectfully submitted,\\n\\nJennifer Hise\\nVice President\\ncemcovp@cemcoturbo.com\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'This question was posted on one of the safety professional LinkedIn networks recently:\\n\\n“Team...If an Incident took place on a Friday or Saturday and Sunday is not a normal work day so the worker was not required to be at work on Sunday but Monday does this constitute a lost time incident?” \\n\\nIs this question about safety or safety improvement?  No.  Given the terminology, it appears to be about compliance with OSHA recordkeeping regulations.\\n\\nUnfortunately, we safety professionals have to become distracted with these questions because we are typically responsible for the injury/illness recordkeeping system at our sites.  If this OSHA Electronic Tracking of Injuries/Illnesses is enacted, we safety professionals will likely experience an ever more intense time and energy investment in this overly complex bookkeeping function instead of being able to focus on our primary value add: safety improvements. \\n\\nI expect to see the LinkedIn professional group discussions more frequently addressing these questions. That is purely a waste of our professional value add. It is a reason that this proposed regulation should be withdrawn.\\n\\nOn another related topic, I have read all of the comments submitted to the docket for this regulation.  What I have observed is that, in general, the supporters of this OSHA regulation do not have to actually do injury/illness recordkeeping.

They may have some nominal injury/illness recordkeeping knowledge because they work in an office which has to maintain injury/illness records.

Reg. 67254. The proposed rule would require employers to electronically submit injury and illness records (300A, 300, 301) to OSHA, which would be made publically available through an online database.\\n\\nI believe exceptional jobsite safety and health practices are inherently good for business. However, the proposed rule does nothing to achieve OSHA's stated goal of reducing injuries, illnesses and fatalities, and instead will force employers to consume large amounts of time and resources on electronic reporting that could be put towards better use. \\n\\nThe proposed rule will allow OSHA to obtain and release to the public detailed information regarding specific workplace injuries and illnesses, including the company, location and incident-specific data. However, this information is not a reliable measure of my company's safety records or its efforts to promote a safe work environment. OSHA would be providing this information to the public without any meaningful context, and I'm very concerned about the data being misconstrued by the public and improper conclusions or assumptions being made about my business. This proposal could easily lead to unwarranted damage to my company's reputation and result in loss of jobs and future work.\\n\\nOSHA's proposal will require my company to submit confidential business details to the agency. This proprietary information would be disclosed to my competitors, and those aiming to threaten or disrupt the security and overall operations of my business. In addition, OSHA also asks the employer to submit sensitive personal information about my employees. Although the agency has stated that it will redact certain personal information from the public disclosures, it has also failed to adequately explain to stakeholders how it plans to accomplish the task. Even with the redaction of names, addresses, physicians, I am concerned that other information could nonetheless unfairly identify an employee. \\n\\nIn the proposal, OSHA states the information received through the mandatory electronic filing of injury and illness records could be used for enforcement efforts. This goes against decades of practice by OSHA, suggesting now that all incidents are the fault of the employer, failing to account for accidents that could be beyond an employers' control. OSHA is now attempting to shame employers into compliance by using data that fails to show the complete narrative of the company's safety record. \\n\\nFinally, OSHA has greatly underestimated the cost this rulemaking will have on businesses.  The agency has failed to account for the time spent training employees, the additional time taken by employers to determine if an injury or illness is work-related, and the costs included with implementing an electronic recordkeeping system. Before the agency moves forward, it must go back and review the costs associated with the proposal. \\n\\nFor all the reasons outlined above, I urge OSHA to withdraw this proposal.  \\n\\nThank you for the opportunity to submit comments on this matter.\",\n",

       "  'Docket ID: OSHA-2013-0023Agency: Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)Parent Agency: Department of Labor (DOL)\\n \\n\\nThere is nothing more important in the workplace than a safe working environment.  As a construction management professional for the last 45 years my over riding message is and always has been, \"Everyone goes home safe every day\".  It seems like an innocuous yet reasonable proposal to ask an employer to keep track of the injuries and illnesses that occur in the workplace.  In truth there are already a tremendous reporting and record keeping requirements being mandated by OHSA, MSHA (at both state and federal levels).   Workplace Safety has to be a culture developed, nurtured and grown over time from within each organization.  More clerical staff keeping more records to submit more reports will not keep my workers safe!  What is lacking is consistent and even oversight, understanding, and enforcement by the regulatory agencies of those existing regulations.  I would challenge OSHA, MSHA and anyone else charged with workplace safety to look internally at your organizations.  I submit that more record keeping is not the answer.  Instead of more Federal clerks to manage paperwork, put more knowledgeable safety professionals in the field working with industry. That would be much more effective, and at the end of the day more people would go home safe.\\n\\nI am totally opposed to this proposal to impose more record keeping!!\\n',\n",

Through prompt and efficient identification, employers will have more accurate tools to reassess potentially hazardous conditions. \\n\\nHowever, there is a potential issue regarding possible duplicative reporting requirements imposed by other governmental agencies. The Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses managed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics also requires a number of employers to submit similar data. Both agencies may need to evaluate and possibly consolidate information reporting requirements imposed on employers to prevent duplicate reports.',\n",

       "  'OSHA\\'s new proposed Recordkeeping rule contains major provisions that would negatively affect Tactical Electronics.  The proposed rule requires small employers with 20 or more workers to submit information electronically from the 300A Annual Summary forms , which OSHA intends to publicize.  OSHA estimates the cost at approximately $9 per employer per year; however, we have deep concern that this number is grossly underestimated and that there will be unforeseen costs of compliance.  Tactical Electronics and other employers would be required to restructure current OSHA compliance program.  There are burdensome steps outlined in the rule, which will likely require companies to take additional steps outside of those described by OSHA to comply.  For example, Tactical Electronics will be required to restructure our current record keeping system as we do not already maintain our workplace injury records in electronic form.   The Recordkeeping rule would require our company to invest man power and financial resources into developing policies and procedures to restructure our current OSHA compliance program.\\n\\nIn addition to the unforeseen costs of compliance, we have concerns that the proposed rule could cause harm to an employer\\'s reputation.  The public perception of employers, including Tactical Electronics, could be at risk and skewed based on the new rule.  The current Recordkeeping framework allows employers\\' records of workplace injuries to remain private to the employer unless OSHA requests  them during an inspection at the workplace or the employer or receives a request for the data from OSHA or the Bureau of Labor Statistics for survey purposes.  There is great risk to employers and employees if OSHA allows this reported information to be publicized.  Under the proposed rule, the public would be provided basic data as stated in the injury and illness record keeping forms.  The public, therefore, would be able to take the injury and illness data out of context.  Although the information publicly accessible would be limited, the results of such decision could be hazardous to our organization.  The public would not be privy to the more lengthy details surrounding the workplace injuries, safety measures the our company has adopted, safety training and compliance programs our company requires of employees, how the data compares to industry averages, or any other relevant information related to the circumstances of the injury or illness.  The proposed rule would automatically place fault of workplace injury and illnesses upon the employer.\\n\\nTactical Electronics is also concerned with the invasion of employee privacy and the release of confidential information.  Although this workplace injury data is proposed to be publicly viewable and only \"basic data,\" the new rule could cause unforeseen harm to our employees.  For small employers such as Tactical Electronics, workplace injuries and illnesses already pose challenges in maintaining employee privacy.   Allowing the public access to OSHA workplace records would cause another administrative burden for small businesses such as ours to protect the confidentiality surrounding our employee\\'s workplace illness and injuries.  Policies and procedures would be required to be written and obtained in order to plan and prepare for such public release of data.  Although employee names and other identifying information would not be published, enough information may be provided about the incident that it would be possible to determine who the employee is to the public, particularly for small businesses such as Tactical Electronics.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nBenjamin Kimbro\\nExecutive Vice-President\\nTactical Electronics',\n",

       "  'My name is Howard Egerman and I am the National Council 220 and General Committee Health and Safety Representative for all Social Security employees.  I strongly support OSHA\\'s proposal about improved tracking of workplace injury and illnesses.  Union health and safey representatives use OSHA logs, and injury and illness logs in order to work with management to reduce injuries and illnesses. All of us need to work backwards and ask why this injury or illness occured and what can be done to prevent future injuries.\\n\\nOur Commander in Chief President Obama has issued an Executive Order for federal workplaces called the Power Inititative to reduce injuries and illnesses and workers compensation costs.  Improved tracking will help us follow our commander in chief\\'s edict.\\n\\nWhen I testified at the last OSHA hearing on ergonomics following President Bush\\'s taking office in 2001, I said at George Mason University that we needed a Marshall Plan for erognomics.We needed to remove the fear of filing for  workers compensation in the federal sector. We need to realize that injuries and illnesses do not just afflict bargaining units but management as well . They are equal opportunity unemployers.\\n\\nOften people do not file claims because they are afraid. We need to remove what I called in 2001 and what still exists the stigma of reporting the stigma of coming forward.  I recall a meeting with a manager years ago who told me \"Howard I have something to tell you.\"  I immediately got afraid I was going to be reprimanded . Instead she whispered \" I have carpal tunnel syndrome, can you help.\"  I believe that this proposal will help stop that stigma .\\n\\nWe are also being a more computerized society.  In fact this is how I was injured my job going from writing to excessive typing.  Having electronic reporting is beneficial.\\n\\nThe third erquirement of the proposal giving OSHA additional means to prohibit emploeyrs from retaliating against employees for reporting injuries and illnesses is long over due.  These incentive based safety award programs in the private sector with so many days of no injuries are truly troublesome.\\n\\nA problem we bargaining unit employees face is management that is tied to numbers and simply view us as a part of the numbers not as people.  Management needs to recognize that good solid documentation , documentation that reflects the actual nature of the workplace benefits us all.\\n\\nI strongly support this proposal  ',\n",

       "  'The Steel Tank Institute/Steel Plate Fabricators Association (STI/SPFA) appreciates the opportunity to submit these comments in response to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (“OSHA”) notice of proposed rulemaking - “Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses” (78 Fed. Reg. 67253, November 8, 2013). \\n\\nSTI/SPFA represents over 170 member companies, employing over 20,000 employees, who may be directly impacted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), United States Department of Labor. \\n\\nPlease see the attached letter for the STI/SPFA comments.',\n",
       "  'Recordkeeping began as a voluntary act to track injury trends. It has turned into something that can make or break your business. Total Recordable Injury Rates have become one of the most important numbers contractors look at when judging multiple potential contracts. This leads to employers becoming \"selective\" or outright lying about their numbers.\\n\\nI do not think this new rule helps reduce cheating or selective reporting. ONLY SIMPLIFICATION of the current rule will even the playing field. If you want honest numbers, do not threaten fines for non-compliance. \\n\\nFirst change- eliminates the prescription medicine rule for record-ability of an injury. We work hard to coach and mentor our employees on post injury actions, but MDs are in the business of prescribing drugs, needed or not. \\n\\nSecond- dont count weekends as lost work days. Its unfair for an employer to record someone as thee days away when they only missed one. (Thursday to Monday issue). \\n\\nThird-Pre-existing injuries that are left off post-offer questionnaires should not count as recordable injuries for the new employer. Furthermore, any employee who omits a prior injury that could interfere with their work should be held to account. \\n\\nAnd lastly, pursue claim fraud more aggressively. Employees have ZERO consequence for filing fraudulent claims unless the employer very expensively pursues the issue. Fine individuals for fraud. \\n\\nEmployers want healthy, safe and productive workplace for their employees and businesses to thrive. More rules and regulations for only the employer do not support these shared goals. \\n',\n",

However, the proposed rule does nothing to achieve OSHA's stated goal of reducing injuries, illnesses and fatalities, and instead will force employers to consume large amounts of time and resources on electronic reporting that could be put towards better use. \\n\\nThe proposed rule will allow OSHA to obtain and release to the public detailed information regarding specific workplace injuries and illnesses, including the company, location and incident-specific data. However, this information is not a reliable measure of my company's safety records or its efforts to promote a safe work environment. OSHA would be providing this information to the public without any meaningful context, and I'm very concerned about the data being misconstrued by the public and improper conclusions or assumptions being made about my business. This proposal could easily lead to unwarranted damage to my company's reputation and result in loss of jobs and future work.\\n\\nOSHA's proposal will require my company to submit confidential business details to the agency. This proprietary information would be disclosed to my competitors, and those aiming to threaten or disrupt the security and overall operations of my business. In addition, OSHA also asks the employer to submit sensitive personal information about my employees. Although the agency has stated that it will redact certain personal information from the public disclosures, it has also failed to adequately explain to stakeholders how it plans to accomplish the task. Even with the redaction of names, addresses, physicians, I am concerned that other information could nonetheless unfairly identify an employee. \\n\\nIn the proposal, OSHA states the information received through the mandatory electronic filing of injury and illness records could be used for enforcement efforts. This goes against decades of practice by OSHA, suggesting now that all incidents are the fault of the employer, failing to account for accidents that could be beyond an employers' control.

If reporting electronically will be similar to the current system, that seems fine.  However, NO COMPANY information should be available to any outside or internal stakeholders.

Don't create more legislation that could expose companies to liability by posting results or making available to anyone the results of their company information.  Can the BLS and OSHA confirm that this is possible?  That's the only way data can be electronically submitted.  The moment BLS or OSHA publishes results with company names; that's the end of electronic submission of data.  Non-union companies do not want Unions with this information.

Reg. 67254.  \\n\\nUTCA is one of the Nation’s largest Construction Associations and is the largest in New Jersey.   The association has operated an extensive construction safety program for its members over the past thirty years.  UTCA’s members rely on federal and state requirements, as well as our own initiatives, to improve the quality of the safety standards maintained under the OSH Act.\\n\\nAs a forerunner to our specific comments on the notice of the proposed rule, UTCA would like to thank the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for extending the deadline for providing all stakeholders with the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule that would require employers to electronically submit injury and illness records (300A, 300, 301) to OSHA, which would be made publicly available through an online database. \\nOur Association prides itself with helping our members understand that job-site safety is good for business. We feel that this proposed rule does not help us with that goal.  It will make construction companies spend more time and resources on reporting instead of them putting their time towards better use.  \\n\\n With this proposed rule, OSHA will have the power to gain, and also release to the public, extremely detailed information regarding specific workplace injuries and illnesses, including the company’s  location and incident-specific data.  The data by itself is not a dependable measuring tool of a company’s safety record or its efforts to promote a safe work environment.  OSHA would be providing this information to the public without any meaningful context, and we’re very  \\nconcerned about the data being misconstrued by the public and improper conclusions or assumptions being made about our member firms’ businesses.  This proposal could then begin to lead to unwarranted damage to a company's reputation and result in jobs and future work being lost.\\n\\nUnder this proposed rule our contractor members will have to submit confidential business details to the OSHA.  This proprietary information would potentially be open to their competitors, and anyone that may want to cause harm to the security and overall operations of their businesses.  In addition, OSHA also asks the employer to submit sensitive personal information about their employees.  While the agency has made it clear that that it will not expose certain personal information in the the public disclosures, it has failed to adequately explain to stakeholders how it plans do so.  Even with the editing of names, addresses and physicians, we are concerned that other information could nonetheless unfairly identify an employee. \\n\\nOSHA states, in this proposal, that information received through the mandatory electronic filing of injury and illness records could be potentially used for enforcement efforts. This would go against decades of practice by OSHA, suggesting now that all incidents are the fault of the employer, failing to account for accidents that could be beyond an employers' control.  OSHA is now attempting to embarrass employers into compliance by using data that fails to show the complete narrative of the company's safety record. \\n\\nFinally, OSHA has greatly underestimated the cost this rule making will have on businesses.  The time spent training employees and time for our members to figure out if an injury or illness is work-related, and the costs of creating an electronic process for keeping these records.  Our contractor members will now have to invest in new record keeping systems to meet these requirements.  Before moving forward the agency should review the costs associated with this rule’s implementation for contractors.\\n\\nPlease take into account all the issues stated above and withdraw this proposal.  \\n\\nThank you for the opportunity to submit comments on this matter.  \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nDaniel Neville\\nDirector of Safety\\n\",\n",

There should be options for paper transmittal.  A minimum of a 3-year phase-in process would allow businesses appropriate time to staff, train, and adapt to a new regulatory requirement.\\n\\nPublication of Electronic Data\\nOSHA’s intention to make all collected data public is of immense concern.  Information is only valuable when it is properly understood, evaluated, and then implemented.  As a minimum, OSHA must plan to manage access to all publically available information, educate users, and take steps to remove the risk of reputation damage and litigation due to misuse of the information.\\n\\nVoluntary Reporting\\nOSHA states that “many corporations now voluntarily report their workplace injury and illness rates in annual “Sustainability Reports”, in order to show investors, stakeholders, and the public that they are committed to positive social values, including workplace safety.”  There is no comparison to an employer currently volunteering to report injury and illness rates and this proposed rule change’s stated intent to make public employer data from Forms 300, 300A, and 301.  OSHA’s statement is not valid.\\n\\nAccuracy of Reported Data\\nThis proposal alters Part 1904 from ‘no-fault’ to ‘at-fault’ and will encourage some employers to either report inaccurate data or not report at all in order to avoid increased public and government scrutiny. OSHA’s statement that “regulation may also improve the accuracy of the reported data\" is unsubstantiated.\\n\\nReporting Requirements\\nThe proposed reporting requirements put a greater burden on employers with 250 or more employees.  The stance taken by OSHA is confusing.   If the data is not valuable for smaller companies, then why collect the data at all?\\n\\nData Dissemination and Use\\nOSHA needs to specifically define how the data collected will be disseminated and utilized in order to achieve OSHA’s stated goals.  There have been no specifics communicated about how the information will be unified into a searchable format.\\n\\nReporting Enforcement\\nIf OSHA does not have a firm plan in place to monitor data submittal compliance by all required employers then no employer should be required to submit data.\\n\\nEconomic Analysis\\nOSHA’s published estimates on the economic costs of this proposed rule changes are woefully underestimated.  Added costs of training on the regulation an certainly legal review of data will be necessary prior to compliance.\\n\\nOSHA Security\\nOSHA is not in a position to guaranty privacy of individuals.  At a minimum, that will require further discussion.\\n\\nConclusion\\nUnfortunately, the proposed changes to this regulation will not improve health and safety but will instead have the opposite effect, negating important steps OSHA has taken already.\\n\\nThe largest negative is that none of the stated good intentions for making the data public are properly quantified.  In addition, there is no assurance that access to the data is only for those who are properly educated to understand or utilize it.  Wrongful use or damage to employers is not addressed.  Larger employers face increased scrutiny with no benefit. No information should be made public in its current, reported format.\\n\\nWe sincerely hope that OSHA reconsiders the changes as currently proposed.  OSHA can meet all the stated goals by seeking out experienced individuals and groups for constructive input.  The proposed approach for collection and dissemination of data, without proper protections in place, is short-sighted and should be postponed. \\n\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nBray International, Inc.\\n',\n",

       "  \"In the industrial workplace (our main focus is refineries, chemical plants, pipeline operations, and fabrication and repair facilities) there has been a lot of discussion about the implications of some things in this proposed rule.  At face value reporting accuracy and  prohibiting retaliation for reporting are positive.  What has been circulating in bulletins are a couple of points that raise alarm among contractors about the details of the proposed rule.  I have been contacted by several clients, my workmen's compensation insurer, and have had dialog with my occupational medical supplier about these points which would have contract requirement implications, as well as management complications.\\n\\nFirst the issue is surrounding post incident drug and alcohol testing:  this is standard operating procedure and a contract requirement in nearly every industrial setting.  This is supported by industry and it is a condition of employment to sign consent to the same.  The goal of all involved is a safe work environment free from illegal drug use and void of alcohol impairment in the workplace.  The rights of the individual should not be considered above the safety of hundreds of fellow workers interacting with and near someone who may be impaired.  Shouldn't every opportunity to identify such members of the community be desired?  Even if the event which initiated the testing was not a direct result in that particular case, identifing the situation could lead to eliminating another impaired judgement that may save the person or others working with or near them from future harm.\\n\\nSecondly the issue of time requirements for reporting injuries is a policy and procedurally mandated by companies.  Employees are trained constantly about no matter how minor  an event seems early reporting gives the best opportunity for adequate evaluation, treatment, and management of the employee's condition.  The ultimate goal is to care for our employees and provide any needed medical as the situation dictates.  The problem we see with removing any reporting protocols are seperating on the job and off the job injuries.  If a worker does high risk activities away from his job (ie. races motocross on the weekend, rides mountain bikes, etc.) and can show up on Monday announce he was injured on the job last week, that puts companies in a very compromised position which is ripe for fraud.   \\n\\nWe would be opposed to these 2 pieces of the proposition. \\n\\n We are winners of both Safety Excellence and Workplace Development Excellence Awards in our industry and strive to be leaders in the industrial workplace.  A culture of excellence is hard to acheive and maintaining it is a challenge, but if the expectations are clear employers and employees are able to rise to the desired level.  I have been a safety professional for 20 years and although protecting people from hazards is a big part of the job, sometimes the job requires protecting people from themselves.\",\n",

       "  'We are a small veteran-owned business and are adamantly opposed to the regulation proposed by OSHA that requires electronic submission of work-related injury and illness information.    First, any additional regulatory requirements create burdens that many small businesses simply cannot afford.  We are already overwhelmed by the amount of oversight imposed by federal, state and local governments and are struggling to retain employees and maintain profitability.   The second opposition is making the information public.  The data that will be provided is not sufficient to accurately reflect a company’s safety policies or practices, could be misinterpreted and negatively impact the ability to obtain work or employees.  Last, we challenge the premise that making accident and illness information public will encourage companies to be more concerned about safety.  We are concerned not because of our reputation but because we care about our employees.',\n",

       "  'Newport News Shipbuilding, a division of Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc., appreciates the opportunity to respond to OSHA’s request for comments regarding the proposed regulation “Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses,” published in the Federal Register on November 8, 2013.  Huntington Ingalls Industries employs approximately 40,000 employees at multiple sites across the nation, including VPP member shipyards in Virginia, Louisiana, and California.  The Virginia site, Newport News Shipbuilding, is the nation’s largest shipyard, with more than 23,000 employees, and the largest OSHA VPP site.  Established in 1886, Newport News Shipbuilding occupies approximately 500 acres and 2.5 miles of waterfront on the James River in Newport News, Virginia.  The Gulf Coast yards comprise about 900 total acres in Mississippi and Louisiana.  In the aggregate, Huntington Ingalls Industries represents approximately 40% of employment in North American Industry Classification System (“NAICS”) 336611, Shipbuilding and Repairing.\\n\\nWhile our organization does support electronic filing and transparency with respect to the injury-reporting process, we have concerns regarding some aspects of the proposed regulation, as the regulation affects employee privacy, proprietary company information, and the general public’s ability to interpret how the injury information relates to workplace risk. \\n\\nFirst, the proposed regulation infringes on the privacy of current and past employees, as it requires the release of personally identifiable information.    We recommend that information \\nprovided to OSHA not include personally identifiable information or that employees have the ability to opt out of having their personally identifiable information provided to OSHA.  \\n\\nSecond, our organization has traditionally treated hours worked as proprietary information, and we have routinely declined to release that information without a non-disclosure agreement from the requesting party.  Public release of this proprietary information could put companies at a competitive disadvantage, as it would unnecessarily disclose work schedule information.  In addition, man-hour information does not assist with the calculation or communication of risk, as injury and illness rates do. \\n\\nFinally, publication of specific injury and illness information will not necessarily provide accurate, current risk information.  For example, some illnesses, such as those resulting from asbestos exposure, have significant latency periods.  In shipbuilding, it is not unusual to record new asbestos diagnoses on the OSHA Form 300 Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses, even though the asbestos hazard is not likely present in the workplace at the time of the diagnosis.   New diagnoses can result from workplace exposure that occurred decades ago, but, under current recordkeeping regulations, these diagnoses are recorded in the year of diagnosis rather than the year of exposure.   If this information is available electronically to individuals unfamiliar with the record-keeping regulations, those individuals may incorrectly assume that all of the illness data is reflective of current risk, rather than a combination of current and previously mitigated risk.     \\n\\nOnce again, Newport News Shipbuilding appreciates the opportunity to comment on the proposed regulation.   We will be pleased to provide additional information or amplification of our comments, should you desire.\\n',\n",

Their shaming press release machine will be running overtime if this regulation is implemented, publicly ridiculing employers who have safety and health professionals on their staffs and those who are in VPP---because they have any injuries and illnesses or violations of OSHA standards.

       "  'I am commenting in regards to OSHA 2013-0023; RIN 1218-AC49.  My primary concern is employee privacy.  As an employer of approximately 340 employees in a non-profit organization, we carefully protect the heatlh information of not only those with disabilties who we support but also our employees.  We do not share/transmit health information or personnel information about our employees via the Internet, through email or related due to issues of security, hacking, identity theft, breaches of private information, etc.  We do not have a high level of confidence in the state or federal government\\'s ability to protect such information during transmission nor for the state or federal government to take responsibiilty if a privacy issue was to surface.  What consideration has been given to components of HIPAA/HITECH which have requiremens for protecting health information?  Why couldn\\'t the federal and/or state government enter into a Business Associate Agreement with employers so there is protection for both parties in the transmission and reporting of health information, as well as a mechanism for sharing responsibility in the event of a breach?\\n\\nI share the concern of another commenter who said, \"While OSHA has committed to protecting the identity of employees, the agency has failed to provide satisfactory answers regarding how it intends to fulfill this mission, especially considering there will be hundreds of thousands of records that would need to be scrubbed of employee details. Furthermore, OSHA has provided no detailed information as to what it believes is personally identifiable information. Employees have an interest in the privacy of their medical information and simply redacting an employee’s name from the various OSHA recordkeeping forms in no way assures employees that their privacy will be protected. This is made even more problematic because the proposal would require the submission and publication of data that could nonetheless identify individuals.  By requiring date of injury, injured body part, treatment and job title, the identity of the employee could be easily determined by an outside entity. For example, in small or rural communities, information concerning an employer is likely to be discernible even if the name of the worker is redacted.\"\\n\\nI recommend this rule be set aside until such time employee privacy issues can be assured and employers protected from litigation in regards to such.  Also consider whether employees will be inclined to report their injuries when they understand that their private information will be made public and their identities may not be sufficientlly protected.\\n',\n",

The proposed rule would require employers to electronically submit injury and illness records (300A, 300, 301) to OSHA, which would be made publically available through an online database.\\n\\nI believe exceptional jobsite safety and health practices are inherently good for business. However, the proposed rule does nothing to achieve OSHA's stated goal of reducing injuries, illnesses and fatalities, and instead will force employers to consume large amounts of time and resources on electronic reporting that could be put towards better use. \\n\\nThe proposed rule will allow OSHA to obtain and release to the public detailed information regarding specific workplace injuries and illnesses, including the company, location and incident-specific data. However, this information is not a reliable measure of my company's safety records or its efforts to promote a safe work environment. OSHA would be providing this information to the public without any meaningful context, and I'm very concerned about the data being misconstrued by the public and improper conclusions or assumptions being made about my business. This proposal could easily lead to unwarranted damage to my company's reputation and result in loss of jobs and future work.\\n\\nOSHA's proposal will require my company to submit confidential business details to the agency. This proprietary information would be disclosed to my competitors, and those aiming to threaten or disrupt the security and overall operations of my business. In addition, OSHA also asks the employer to submit sensitive personal information about my employees. Although the agency has stated that it will redact certain personal information from the public disclosures, it has also failed to adequately explain to stakeholders how it plans to accomplish the task. Even with the redaction of names, addresses, physicians, I am concerned that other information could nonetheless unfairly identify an employee. \\n\\nIn the proposal, OSHA states the information received through the mandatory electronic filing of injury and illness records could be used for enforcement efforts. This goes against decades of practice by OSHA, suggesting now that all incidents are the fault of the employer, failing to account for accidents that could be beyond an employers' control. OSHA is now attempting to shame employers into compliance by using data that fails to show the complete narrative of the company's safety record. \\n\\nFinally, OSHA has greatly underestimated the cost this rulemaking will have on businesses.  The agency has failed to account for the time spent training employees, the additional time taken by employers to determine if an injury or illness is work-related, and the costs included with implementing an electronic recordkeeping system.

       "  'OSHA has declared injury/illness recordkeeping as no fault.  It is written as such in the early portion of 29 CFR 1904 and is reinforced by this interpretive letter from OSHA.\\n\\nBeth Nelson\\nState of Wyoming\\nDepartment of Employment\\nCheyenne Business Center\\n1510 East Pershing Blvd.\\nCheyenne, Wyoming 82002 \\n\\nDear Ms. Nelson: \\n\\nThis is in response to your letter dated August 14, 2002. Thank you for your comments pertaining to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration\\'s (OSHA) Injury and Illness Recording and Reporting Requirements contained in 29 CFR Part 1904. \\n\\nOSHA revised its injury and illness recordkeeping requirements under the following rulemaking procedures. On February 2, 1996, the agency published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) requesting public comment on the proposed revision to the recordkeeping requirements. OSHA received more than 450 comments and held six days of public meetings. OSHA analyzed all information from the public meetings and developed its final rule based upon that analysis. On January 19, 2001, OSHA published its final rule. \\n\\nSpecifically, you ask OSHA to reconsider requiring employers to record and report work-related fatalities, injuries and illnesses incurred due to no fault of the employer or employee. You also provide an example of a case that illustrates your concerns. We are assuming that the auto accident in your example meets OSHA\\'s definition of work-relatedness. In the final rule, OSHA notes that many circumstances that lead to a recordable work-related injury or illness are \"beyond the employer\\'s control.\" Nevertheless, because such an injury or illness was caused, contributed to, or significantly aggravated by an event or exposure at work, it must be recorded on the OSHA form (assuming that it meets one or more of the recording criteria and does not qualify for an exception to the geographic presumption). This approach is consistent with the no-fault recordkeeping system OSHA has historically adopted, which includes work-related injuries and illnesses, regardless of the level of employer control or non-control involved. The concept of fault has never been a consideration in any recordkeeping system of the U.S. Department of Labor. Both the Note to Subpart A of the final rule and the new OSHA Form 300 expressly state that recording a case does not indicate fault, negligence, or compensability. In addition, OSHA recognizes that injury and illness rates do not necessarily indicate a lack of interest in safety and health or success or failure per se. OSHA feels it is to the benefit of all parties to go beyond the numbers and look at an employer\\'s safety and health program. \\n\\nI hope that you find this information useful. Thank you for your interest in occupational safety and health and OSHA. If you have any further questions, please contact the Division of Recordkeeping Requirements, at 202-693-1702.\\n\\n\\nSo this, again, begs the question, how can this recordkeeping system have a relationship to safety?  Why is it being proposed to allow activist groups to harass employers with safety programs and safety staffs to support them? \\n',\n",

Reg. 67254. The proposed rule would require employers to electronically submit injury and illness records (300A, 300, 301) to OSHA, which would be made publically available through an online database.\\n\\nI believe exceptional jobsite safety and health practices are inherently good for business. However, the proposed rule does nothing to achieve OSHA's stated goal of reducing injuries, illnesses and fatalities, and instead will force employers to consume large amounts of time and resources on electronic reporting that could be put towards better use. \\n\\nThe proposed rule will allow OSHA to obtain and release to the public detailed information regarding specific workplace injuries and illnesses, including the company, location and incident-specific data. However, this information is not a reliable measure of my company's safety records or its efforts to promote a safe work environment. OSHA would be providing this information to the public without any meaningful context, and I'm very concerned about the data being misconstrued by the public and improper conclusions or assumptions being made about my business. This proposal could easily lead to unwarranted damage to my company's reputation and result in loss of jobs and future work.\\n\\nOSHA's proposal will require my company to submit confidential business details to the agency. This proprietary information would be disclosed to my competitors, and those aiming to threaten or disrupt the security and overall operations of my business. In addition, OSHA also asks the employer to submit sensitive personal information about my employees. Although the agency has stated that it will redact certain personal information from the public disclosures, it has also failed to adequately explain to stakeholders how it plans to accomplish the task. Even with the redaction of names, addresses, physicians, I am concerned that other information could nonetheless unfairly identify an employee. \\n\\nIn the proposal, OSHA states the information received through the mandatory electronic filing of injury and illness records could be used for enforcement efforts. This goes against decades of practice by OSHA, suggesting now that all incidents are the fault of the employer, failing to account for accidents that could be beyond an employers' control. OSHA is now attempting to shame employers into compliance by using data that fails to show the complete narrative of the company's safety record. \\n\\nFinally, OSHA has greatly underestimated the cost this rulemaking will have on businesses.  The agency has failed to account for the time spent training employees, the additional time taken by employers to determine if an injury or illness is work-related, and the costs included with implementing an electronic recordkeeping system. Before the agency moves forward, it must go back and review the costs associated with the proposal. \\n\\nFor all the reasons outlined above, I urge OSHA to withdraw this proposal.  \\n\\nThank you for the opportunity to submit comments on this matter.\",\n",

Reg. 67254. The proposed rule would require employers to electronically submit injury and illness records (300A, 300, 301) to OSHA, which would be made publically available through an online database.\\n\\nI believe exceptional jobsite safety and health practices are inherently good for business. However, the proposed rule does nothing to achieve OSHA's stated goal of reducing injuries, illnesses and fatalities, and instead will force employers to consume large amounts of time and resources on electronic reporting that could be put towards better use. \\n\\nThe proposed rule will allow OSHA to obtain and release to the public detailed information regarding specific workplace injuries and illnesses, including the company, location and incident-specific data. However, this information is not a reliable measure of my company's safety records or its efforts to promote a safe work environment. OSHA would be providing this information to the public without any meaningful context, and I'm very concerned about the data being misconstrued by the public and improper conclusions or assumptions being made about my business. This proposal could easily lead to unwarranted damage to my company's reputation and result in loss of jobs and future work.\\n\\nOSHA's proposal will require my company to submit confidential business details to the agency. This proprietary information would be disclosed to my competitors, and those aiming to threaten or disrupt the security and overall operations of my business. In addition, OSHA also asks the employer to submit sensitive personal information about my employees. Although the agency has stated that it will redact certain personal information from the public disclosures, it has also failed to adequately explain to stakeholders how it plans to accomplish the task. Even with the redaction of names, addresses, physicians, I am concerned that other information could nonetheless unfairly identify an employee. \\n\\nIn the proposal, OSHA states the information received through the mandatory electronic filing of injury and illness records could be used for enforcement efforts. This goes against decades of practice by OSHA, suggesting now that all incidents are the fault of the employer, failing to account for accidents that could be beyond an employers' control. OSHA is now attempting to shame employers into compliance by using data that fails to show the complete narrative of the company's safety record. \\n\\nFinally, OSHA has greatly underestimated the cost this rulemaking will have on businesses.  The agency has failed to account for the time spent training employees, the additional time taken by employers to determine if an injury or illness is work-related, and the costs included with implementing an electronic recordkeeping system. Before the agency moves forward, it must go back and review the costs associated with the proposal. \\n\\nFor all the reasons outlined above, I urge OSHA to withdraw this proposal.  \\n\\nThank you for the opportunity to submit comments on this matter.\",\n",

       "  'RE:      Docket No. OSHA-2013-0023\\n\\n            Proposed Rule to Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses\\n\\nTo Whom It May Concern:\\n\\nI appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to establish improvements for tracking of workplace injuries and illnesses. Work safety and the health of my family and my employees is a top priority for my family farm and something we focus on every day in New York.\\n\\nI have some serious concerns about this rule related to privacy and safety, and I urge OSHA to withdraw this prosed regulation.\\n\\nThe proposed rule would require employers to electronically submit injury and illness information currently in the 300A, 300, 301 Forms to OSHA. Employers with 20 or more employees would have to report annually with no paper options. The agency also would have discretion under the proposal to require any employer to submit more detailed information about specific injuries and illnesses. A major concern is that fact that OSHA has not been able to justify its reasoning for how this data will be used.\\n\\nOSHA intends to provide public online access to the injury and illness records so the public, including employers, employees, potential employees, researchers, consumers, and labor organizations and businesses will have full accessibility to this data. Currently, farmers are required to complete injury information for OSHA’s use, however, the information is not generally available to the public and is available only to researchers on a basis consistent with confidential data. The injury data will be released without proper context relating to how or why an accident occurred. Without the proper context, the data will not be reflected as a reliable measure of an employer’s safety records or its efforts to promote a safe work environment. This could lead to misinterpretation of data and false assumptions and conclusions about an employer. It presents the opportunity for interest groups to mischaracterize and misuse information for topics unrelated to safety.\\n\\nAllowing private information such as the company name, location, home addresses, home contact information, and incident-specific data to become public information raises privacy concerns for farmers. Since many farmers live where they work, this creates a direct threat. Not only could this affect the safety of the employer but that of family members and employees. The data may be used for unintended purposes by those who seek to target agricultural farms and businesses. This creates a public safety concern as well as an animal welfare concern as OSHA intends to publish the addresses of farm businesses, which routinely produce, store, and maintain highly sensitive, hazardous, or valuable products or commodities.\\n\\nUnder the prosed rule, OSHA would require that all records be submitted electronically. The agency assumes that most businesses keep electronic records and would be able to submit records electronically. However, some businesses do not have access to computers and broadband internet. In many parts of rural New York, reliable internet access remains a problem, and a rule that requires only electronic submissions does not recognize the challenges that business in rural America face. Nationally, 68 percent of farms own or lease a computer and 67 percent have internet access, but only about 40 percent of farmers actually use a computer to conduct farm business. Electronic submission would only cause undue hardship for some farmers and consideration should be given for paper submissions.  \\n\\nFor these reasons, I urge OSHA to withdraw this proposed rule. Thank you for considering these comments.\\n',\n",

       "  \"More and more companies want to do business with companies that provide safe working conditions and positive environmental benefits to the communities. The proposed rule of making available injury and reporting data can assist companies in making their decisions easier. It should be cautioned however that not every company will properly report and this can lead to an improper view of a company's safety performance. In the past, many companies have skewed documents and earnings to appeal to the stakeholders and increase profits for high-level management, Phar-mor and Enron come to mind. If all companies operated with honesty and integrity, these discussions would not need to happen. Unfortunately, in real-world corporate America, doing the best for the bottom-line takes priority over doing best for the employees and public. \\nIf this rule is to proceed, the public who may use this as a business tool needs to be educated on the data that will be available. Another concern is what increased penalty should occur for companies who intentional mis-report for business gain. \\nWith an educated public and consequences for companies who intentionally mis-report, this can be a useful, educated business tool for the public.\\n\\nRespectfully submitted,\\n\\nStephen Hughes, M.S. OSH\",\n",
       "  'PMPA disagrees with OSHAs characterization of the employees obligation to report injuries and illnesses as a right; it is clearly a duty or obligation as explained in the General Duty Clause (employees shall comply with occupational safety and health standards and all rules, regulations, and orders issued pursuant to this Act which are applicable to his own actions and conduct. 29 U.S.C.  654, 5 (b)(1)).\\n\\nWe disagree that there is a need for further rulemaking in this area.\\n\\nWe are very concerned that the as-yet unpublished regulatory text alluded to in the Supplemental Notice will actually become an obstacle to our ability to manage safety and hazard identification in our shops. By changing the understanding of our employees obligation to report injuries and illnesses to a right to report, we feel that employees will see this new rulemaking as giving them discretion to NOT report. \\n\\nThe existing regulations about reporting injuries and illnesses are clear. The duty of employees to report injuries and illnesses is also clear. There is no need for OSHA to sow confusion by creating semantic puzzles over obligations versus rights. In the absence of any evidence beyond undocumented anecdotes, the idea that there needs to be further work on injury and illness reporting regulations is unfounded. Employers shall comply with occupational safety and health standards promulgated under this Act, and Each employee shall comply with occupational safety and health standards and all rules, regulations, and orders issued pursuant to this Act which are applicable to his own actions and conduct leave no doubt as to the obligations of all parties.\\n\\nReporting of injuries and illnesses is not a right. It is an obligation of the employee to report; and a responsibility of the employer to record, investigate, and take appropriate remedial actions to retrain as necessary and to remove any hazards so identified. \\n\\nFor these reasons, and the reasons given in our attached letter,  earlier submitted comments, and testimony at the January hearing, the PMPA urges OSHA to withdraw both the proposed regulation and Supplemental Notice. In the absence of actual regulatory text for us to review, OSHA creates only uncertainty regarding employers duties and obligations. Furthermore, by ignoring OSHAs own rule that employee compliance is a duty, OSHA potentially creates a means for employees to fail to report injuries and illnesses, with the proliferation of unrecognized hazards in workplaces across the country as a probable result.',\n",

       "  'Ladies and Gentlemen:\\n\\nI\\'m not an attorney or lobbyist so my comments may not align with other comments that have been made.  I\\'m just the Production Coach for our small company and my duties include providing a safe work environment for our valued employees.  Please excuse my lack of expertise in wording this reply.\\n\\nI\\'m against your proposed electronic 300A form posting proposal.  Instead, I would ask you to consider spending the money (that this proposal would require) to partner with small American companies (under and over your 250 employee threshold) and consult with them on improving long-term safety.  Please consider creating a positive environment for companies to work with OSHA instead of regulating them to DEATH (closure).  Our company was 321 employees strong before the Great Recession.  We went down to 43 employees due to the economy and are currently back up to 93 employees.  I state this to let you know we don\\'t currently fall under the proposed regulation, but we hope to grow back to where we were (which would be impacted by the proposed regulation).\\n\\nFrom my perspective, this proposal will not improve our worker\\'s safety, but it would add cost and frustrations to our operations!  You keep piling on more and more requirements seemingly without any thought to how you are impacting the capability of companies to remain in business or improve our people\\'s safety (I do understand the safest company is a closed company, but I hope you don\\'t want that).  Additionally, I don\\'t believe you are considering how to best use your dollars to improve our people\\'s safety.  Obviously, you don\\'t have to concern yourselves with profitability to remain in business, but all private companies do have that concern.  I would like to see a more balanced approach within OSHA.  Can you find a way to encourage and partner with safety-conscious companies?  For instance, our company has taken extraordinary steps to have the California and Oklahoma OSHA Consulting groups into our CA and OK plants to help us improve our ability to provide a safe working environment for our employees.  Why not reward companies that are proactive in safety instead of treating all companies like irresponsible institutions?  Why not find ways to assist American companies in becoming safer through partnership with OSHA Consulting instead of slapping us around and causing us to close down our companies because we are tired of opposition instead of cooperation?  Why can’t you bring balance to this program?  I believe OSHA is one of the largest forces for off shoring jobs that there is.  That isn\\'t a good thing for our American workers.\\n\\nWhen we cease to celebrate the positive things in our lives, there is only more and more awareness of the negative.  Please help us focus on celebrating the positive.  Please help us regain a balanced approach to government.  Not with spin, but reality.  How could OSHA be a force to celebrate what good things are occurring and influence companies to improve safety which in reality improves profitability on a long-term basis and is the right thing to do?\\n\\nWhy not put more emphasis on helping American companies improve safety in their workplaces instead of making them expend valuable resources to jump through hoops you create without any corresponding benefit?  Why not help American workers take pride in and improve the places they work by expending your resources to provide positive guidance instead of making employers expend money to jump through meaningless hoops.  Please realize that companies that take a long-term view of business want to provide a safe working environment to their employees.  You are the experts so please help us improve safety by partnering with us instead of opposing us.  Lately, your regulations have taken a very short-term stance that is detrimental to American workers.  You are becoming more political instead of practical unless you adhere to the thought that the safest company is a closed company.  It seems like your department is more concerned about \"spin\" than reality.  I would like to see that changed if possible so we really do improve our work places for our people.\\n\\nIn the past, I have assisted California OSHA by sitting on safety advisory committees and it seems to me that CAL OSHA inspectors are more concerned with wording the regulations so they could fine companies than they were with protecting workers.  I would request you reflect on the reasons OSHA was established and determine if your current course of action accomplishes this goal.\\n\\nThank you for your consideration.\\n',\n",

       "  'Several posts to this docket have recommended approval of this regulation on the basis that electronic submission and transmission of injury/illness data will improve safety and move OSHA and data collection into the modern era.\\n\\nImprovement in quality and usefulness through an electronic generation system just cannot occur with this data. The injury/illness record keeping system is excessively complex--brought about by multiple interpretations, revisions and restatements of the regulations that were developed from the original requirements for it in the OSHAct.  Just this fact alone is indicative of how flawed and unnecessary this record keeping system truly is. If a regulation has to be repetitively interpreted and explained, it is most likely to be highly difficult for compliance, especially for the millions of sites that have no on-site safety staff to sort this out.  Injury/illness record keeping in this data system is simply to meet compliance with the OSHAct, not for safety.\\n\\nCompliance with this injury/illness record keeping system is largely about understanding how to record information on a huge variety of medical outcomes.  Creating the data electronically will, thus, not improve it or be indicative of safety or safety improvements at work sites. Instead it will impose additional and unnecessary compliance burdens on the regulated community.  Its purpose is to empower the OSHA press office public shaming press releases program.  It is also intended to empower advocacy groups who seek to use this data as a means for wrongly portraying selected employers as having no interest in protection of their employees from hazards. \\n\\nThe absolutely unnecessary burdens of compliance with this regulation will fall the hardest on site safety professionals who will have to refocus their efforts on OSHA compliance instead of safety—which is just wrong!\\n\\nThomas Lawrence, CSP, P.E.\\n',\n",
       "  'February 26, 2014\\n\\nOSHA Docket Office\\nDocket No. OSHA-2010-0034\\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration,  Room N-2625\\n200 Constitution Avenue NW\\nWashington, DC 20210\\n\\nRe: \\tDocket No. OSHA-2013-0023\\nProposed Rule - Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses\\n\\nTo the Docket Office:\\n\\nRed Gold Inc is a full-line tomato processing company located in Elwood, Indiana.  Our company is a member of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). The NAM has also filed comments on this proposed regulation and Red Gold fully supports the position of the NAM and incorporates those comments by reference. \\n\\n\\tAs an employer impacted by this proposed rule, Red Gold is submitting these separate comments to independently express its concerns regarding this rule and the negative consequences that are likely to result if this rule becomes final.  Of significant concern is the public release of information that our business treats as confidential commercial information – employee hours worked. Additionally, we are concerned about the release of employee personally identifiable information and the misuse of raw injury and illness data by third parties.\\n\\n\\tFor the reasons stated below, and those addressed in the NAM’s comments Red Gold requests that OSHA withdraw this proposed regulation.\\n\\nRed Gold considers the total employee hours worked to be confidential commercial information. OSHA historically has also treated employee hours worked as confidential commercial information and has protected such information from disclosure pursuant to FOIA Exemption 4, which prohibits the release of confidential commercial information provided to the government.\\n\\n\\tWe are also troubled by the fact that the agency has provided no detailed information as to what it believes is personally identifiable information. Employees have an interest in the privacy of their medical information and simply redacting an employee’s name from the various OSHA recordkeeping forms in no way assures employees that their privacy will be protected.\\n\\n\\tIt is a concern regarding the potential misuse of injury and illness data by third parties. While OSHA claims that the publication of raw injury and illness data will improve research in occupational safety and health, the agency cannot ignore that this information will be used by others for purposes other than safety and health. \\n\\nThis data lacks meaningful context and rates alone cannot be compared to identify those employers more likely to have future injuries or illnesses. Raw injury and illness information is not a reliable measure of an employer’s safety record or its efforts to promote a safe work environment. There are many factors outside of an employer’s control that contribute to workplace accidents and contribute to an employer’s overall injury and illness rate.\\n\\nProviding raw data to those who do not know how to interpret it or without putting such data in context will inevitably lead to improper conclusions or assumptions about employers.  Moreover, OSHA anticipates that employees and the public will make decisions about where to work or where to do business based on these rates alone. Making such decisions based on a number without additional context will have unintended consequences, such as damage to a company’s reputation and potential loss of business and jobs.\\n\\n•\\tOSHA lacks statutory authority under the Occupational Safety & Health Act of 1970 (“OSH Act”) for making an employer’s raw injury and illness data available to the general public. Section 8(c)(2) provides the Secretary with authority to draft regulations requiring employers to maintain accurate records of work-related deaths, injuries and illnesses. Nothing in this section grants the Secretary the authority to publish these records to the general public.\\n\\n•\\tMoreover, the publication of such information is not reasonably related to the purposes of the OSH Act. The Secretary has provided no support for assertions that making such information available to the public will further workplace safety and health. In fact, OSHA has previously claimed that making such information available to the general public is unnecessary and useless.\\n\\n•\\tThis proposed rule targets employers for enforcement by OSHA and “regulation by shaming” in contradiction to the stated purpose of the recordkeeping standard – that is recording a work-related injury or illness “does not mean that the employer or employee was at fault, that an OSHA rule has been violated….” 29 C.F.R. § 1904.0\\n\\nRespectfully submitted,\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSteve Austin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGovernment Affairs\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'As experienced safety professionals employed at a manufacturing company with decades of industrial workplace experience, we respectfully offer the following comments on two of the questions posed in the supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking.\\n\\n\\n1. Are you aware of situations where employers have discouraged the reporting of injuries and illnesses? \\n\\nWe are not aware of any employers discouraging injury reporting.  In our experience, most companies meticulously track promptness of injury reporting as a leading safety indicator and many actually reward prompt injury reporting.  Most employers recognize that when employees do not report injuries the economic impact is ultimately greater than when employees accurately report injuries and do so in a timely manner.  The additional costs include:  (1) increased injury frequency; (2) increased severity; (3) failure to correct root causes of injuries; (4) inadequate medical treatment of the original injury due to inaccurate or untimely reporting; (5) regulatory penalties for failing to comply with the requirements of 29 CFR 1904.4(a); and (6) a direct contradiction of most companies safety policies requiring full regulatory compliance.  Our company, like many others of which we are aware, requires initial training and frequent refresher training for all employees on company policy concerning reporting of all injuries, no matter how slight, so proper medical treatment can be immediately provided and the root causes of the injury can be promptly corrected to prevent a recurrence of the injury.   \\n\\n\\n2. Will the fact that employer injury and illness statistics will be publically available on the Internet cause some employers to discourage their employees from reporting injuries and illnesses?    \\n\\nOSHAs Internet publication of injury specifics will not cause employers to discourage injury reporting because unreported injuries cost companies far more than reported injuries, as discussed above.  Internet publication of injuries will, on the contrary, provide a powerful disincentive for employees not to report their own injuries.  Personal embarrassment is already a disincentive to injury reporting where only company co-workers could learn about reported injuries.  The embarrassment disincentive to injury reporting could become even greater if the entire (virtual) world via the Internet were informed of their injuries.  Even with the name of the injured employee excluded from the internet posting, all the other details of the injury would allow plant co-workers and their social network to associate the injury with the name of the employee.  Employees have become increasingly sensitized to increased invasions of privacy, governmental eavesdropping, Internet hackers, etc.  Injured employees would have the further injury reporting disincentive of fearing that internet publication of their injuries would potentially negatively affect their employers financial performance and thus their own future.\\n\\nWe believe that Internet posting of injury specifics would have a major impact on employees not to report injuries and would significantly reduce the ability of employers to identify needs and implement corrective actions to prevent injury recurrences.\\n',\n",

These ginning associations represent some 670 individual cotton gin operations throughout the seventeen cotton-producing states.  The NCGA submits these comments to OSHA in response to its proposal to Improve Tracking of Workplace Injuries and Illnesses (78 FR 217; Nov. 8, 2013).  \\n\\nNCGA has serious concerns about this proposed rule in terms of employee privacy and employer liability.  In the rural Cottonbelt, the gin and a few other small business may be the only employers in a community.  Gins will typically have from five to a dozen full time employees, averaging 25 employees during peak periods.  It will be difficult for confidentiality to be maintained in these small communities.  If a worker wants to maintain some measure of privacy, this proposal will make this much more difficult to maintain.   \\n\\nIn the proposed rule, OSHA argues that posting injury and illness information on the internet in a public database is no different than keeping this same information on file in a place of business and making this information available to an OSHA inspector.  They further argue that personal information will be removed from the data, so the employee’s privacy is protected. \\n\\nOSHA is assuming each employer will have a clerk simply enter the data from the OSHA 301 form into the database.  In reality, because of liability concerns, employers are more likely to have higher level management review to ensure any data entered is done accurately and in the most anonymous manner allowed.  This type of system will inherently set up situations where workers feel their privacy is being violated, and the workers will likely hold their employer responsible when this violation occurs.  OSHA also assumes that most employers are already keeping records electronically, although OSHA acknowledges that a portion of small businesses do not have immediate access to computers and internet services.  Therefore, if OSHA finalize this proposed rule, they must give consideration to allowing paper submissions.\\n\\nThe NCGA is closely involved in the development of, and in the distribution of, educational and training resources.  As a part of this effort, we have spent considerable effort identifying and eliminating hazards in our industry.  In most cases, it takes significant follow-up to determine the cause of each specific injury.  To make the assumption that the public can review simple injury data and make reasonable conclusions regarding needed improvements in a business is unrealistic on OSHA’s part.  This proposal has the potential of hindering overall safety efforts because the employer may be forced to move from a mode of determining the cause of the injury and preventing it to determining the public perception caused by the injury and addressing that issue.  \\n\\nNCGA believes this rulemaking has a very limited potential benefit, and will have little to no benefit for worker safety.  There is real concern about whether employee privacy can be protected and that employers’ safety records could be mischaracterized and misused.  Therefore, we urge OSHA to withdraw this rulemaking.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n \\nHarrison Ashley\\nExecutive Vice President\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'While I support OHSA and the necessity for this organization I do not see the need for making the data public information and will open companies and organizations for negative public scrutiny. Government agencies have show that they are not good at protecting information. There is a possibility that the information will violate injured people’s privacy.  Not to mention what else will the data be used for besides tracking work place injuries.\\n\\nAs the report states companies already have to document all work place injuries and retain these records. There is no need for every company to submit electronically quarterly or annually when there is already the annual OSHA injury and illness survey of ten or more employers in place. If OSHA wants more data request it from more employers more often.  There is no issue with OHSA gathering information on how to improve safety and work environment but it is not necessary to make company information public.\\n\\nThis new rule will be a setback to all of the progress that OHSA has made over the years, by using public perception to guilt employers to provide safe work environments, I feel they will only find ways to hide injuries  to promote a positive image after all the bottom line is all most companies pay real attention to. The companies that do put the effort into a safe work environment and that will track and report the injuries will be the ones that are hurt the most by this new rule.\\n',\n",

       "  \"I respectfully submit that OSHA already has rules in place to prevent retaliation against employees who exercise their rights, and I agree that employees should be treated fairly and encouraged not to be intimidated in regards to reporting of injuries.  I also agree that the reporting methods should not be overly burdensome on the employee.  With the requirements in this proposed rule, however, I feel that we are on the verge of placing so much emphasis on employee rights that we negate the rights of the employer.\\n\\nAlthough it is true that some employers may have policies or procedures which discourage reporting of injuries, does the employer not at least have a right to require timely reporting?  Otherwise, his right to investigate, provide proper treatment and follow-up, and defend against fraudulent claims is voided, or at least severely impeded.  \\n\\nWithout timely injury reporting requirements, a worker can much more easily incur an injury that is totally unrelated to work and then claim it happened on the job.  Or, in some cases a minor workplace injury that is unreported and left untreated could result in a serious injury.\\n\\nConsider, for example, an employee who gets a minor cut to his hand but does not report it for a week.  In the meantime, the hand is not properly treated and gets badly infected.  Because the employer did not have the opportunity to provide first aid treatment and follow-up on the injury, an otherwise minor injury culminates in medical attention, prescription drugs, restricted duty, job duty transfer, loss of production, and/or days away from work.  Additionally, the employer's Overall Incident Rate and Workers' Compensation premiums increase and the company is unfairly subjected to increased scrutiny, especially if the final rule requires online public reporting as proposed.\\n\\nIn an effort to increase employee rights, are we at risk of throwing the employer's rights out the window?  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'Although I\\'m not fond of the quarterly electronic reporting as I believe it is burdensome and I don\\'t believe that quarterly reporting will improve accurate reporting or be used readily by OSHA. Annual reporting of the data would be sufficient as it takes a year or more for the information to be published. \\n\\nI can honestly say that during OSHA inspections I have been part of the OSHA officer found that we were over reporting by listing injuries that were only first aid or under reporting our hours worked. So if you are looking for more accurate reporting of numbers I don\\'t see that this will help. For years OSHA issued high dollar fines for large companies that made false reports yet years later we still have inaccurate reporting of data.\\n\\nNow the August 14, 2014 suggested additions of the recordkeeping requirements will be a serious hit to an employer to enforce safety policies and rules. \\n\\nCurrently our company will issue disciplinary action for employees that have been trained on safety rules and given the proper tools to comply. \\n\\nExample, we conduct training on our lockout policy and employees are give locks and sign off that they understand and will comply with our policy. If an employee is ever caught in equipment without proper lockout that employee is immediately suspended for a minimum of 2 days, we have even suspended MANAGEMENT for not making sure the employee is locked out. \\n\\nWith the suggested addition that an employer can not take disciplinary action if an employee is injured, this will not allow us to hold employees accountable if that employee fails to lockout the equipment and is injured we can not take the normal disciplinary action because the employee was injured!\\n\\nDOT requires drug and alcohol testing after a \"recordable\" DOT accident. This testing is done without reasonable cause and if not accomplished the DOT will fine the trucking company. If OSHA says we can not conduct drug testing unless there is reasonable cause, this will NOT help in making the workplace safer it will keep those that use drugs working and in our case behind the controls of heavy equipment that can seriously hurt or kill someone if they are not concentrating on the job at hand and under the influence of drugs or alcohol. \\n\\nSome employee that are under the influence do not have tell tale signs that can be easily identified because they are always under the influence. I have seen people test positive after injuries that I would NOT want working next to me with the chance he or she might high on drugs. This addition to the record keeping standard will set safety back 20 years when no employers were conducting drug tests!\\n\\nThese latest suggested additions in August will do nothing for the improvement of reporting but will sure increase injury stats and in fact will be several steps backwards in the effort to improve safety in our operations.',\n",

However, the proposed rule does nothing to achieve OSHA's stated goal of reducing injuries, illnesses and fatalities, and instead will force employers to consume large amounts of time and resources on electronic reporting that could be put towards better use. \\n\\nThe proposed rule will allow OSHA to obtain and release to the public detailed information regarding specific workplace injuries and illnesses, including the company, location and incident-specific data. However, this information is not a reliable measure of my company's safety records or its efforts to promote a safe work environment. OSHA would be providing this information to the public without any meaningful context, and I'm very concerned about the data being misconstrued by the public and improper conclusions or assumptions being made about my business. This proposal could easily lead to unwarranted damage to my company's reputation and result in loss of jobs and future work.\\n\\nOSHA's proposal will require my company to submit confidential business details to the agency. This proprietary information would be disclosed to my competitors, and those aiming to threaten or disrupt the security and overall operations of my business. In addition, OSHA also asks the employer to submit sensitive personal information about my employees. Although the agency has stated that it will redact certain personal information from the public disclosures, it has also failed to adequately explain to stakeholders how it plans to accomplish the task. Even with the redaction of names, addresses, physicians, I am concerned that other information could nonetheless unfairly identify an employee. \\n\\nIn the proposal, OSHA states the information received through the mandatory electronic filing of injury and illness records could be used for enforcement efforts. This goes against decades of practice by OSHA, suggesting now that all incidents are the fault of the employer, failing to account for accidents that could be beyond an employers' control. OSHA is now attempting to shame employers into compliance by using data that fails to show the complete narrative of the company's safety record. \\n\\nFinally, OSHA has greatly underestimated the cost this rulemaking will have on businesses.  The agency has failed to account for the time spent training employees, the additional time taken by employers to determine if an injury or illness is work-related, and the costs included with implementing an electronic recordkeeping system. Before the agency moves forward, it must go back and review the costs associated with the proposal. \\n\\nFor all the reasons outlined above, I urge OSHA to withdraw this proposal.  \\n\\nThank you for the opportunity to submit comments on this matter.\",\n",

       "  'Providing a formalized regulatory framework that creates expectations that employers are not to hide or discourage the reporting of injuries is extremely important.  Further, if employers are shown to complicate the process of reporting injuries, this should be dealt with in a punitive manner.   \\n\\nFrom an operational standpoint, the only way safety can improve is if ALL unsafe events, accidents, injuries, and recordables are documented.  Removing the fear of reporting for the employees will only be helped if the regulatory environment delineates penalties for those organizations who purposely try to keep reports of injuries from being made.

       "  '\\nFebruary 28, 2014\\n\\nOSHA Docket-2013-0023\\nRIN 1218-AC49\\nUS Department of Labor\\nRoom N-2625\\n200 Constitution Avenue NW\\nWashington, DC 20210\\n\\n\\nDear Sir or Madam:\\n\\nThe Association of Occupational Health Professional in Healthcare (AOHP) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule change for OSHA recordkeeping.  AOHP supports OSHA’s rationale for the proposed change especially the need to have more “real time” data on injury and illnesses especially in high risk industries. \\nHowever, AOHP has a number of areas we would like to offer comments:\\n•\\tIt is not clear that there has been an interface between the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and OSHA with the sharing of injury data as it is currently submitted. Would this new reporting process replace the BLS reports?\\n•\\tClarification is needed as to whether or not the quarterly reports would need to be signed off by the organization’s Executive.\\n•\\tFor organizations that have multiple sites, would each site need to report on a quarterly basis?  An example in healthcare would be that many health systems have acute care facilities and off-site locations such as clinics, surgery centers, physician practices. These off-site locations may be a few to over 50 or more. \\n•\\tThe need to double enter the data is a significant concern. Double data entry was a significant concern when NIOSH was proposing the Occupational Safety Health Network (OHSN). NIOSH considered this concern and was able to create an interface to eliminate double data entry into this national database. Double data entry is costly in terms of time and the use of scarce human resources to manage these record keeping requirements. Would days away, restricted, transfer days and lost time days need to be entered and then updated with each quarterly report?\\n•\\tConsideration should be given to a pilot to test the functioning of the website and the ease with which the data can be entered and submitted.\\n•\\tOSHA has explored a number of alternatives and approaches to implementing the changes. In order to decrease confusion, if the recordkeeping requirements were to change, a consistent approach should be established with all employers required to report at the time the new requirements were implemented.\\n•\\tAOHP views the sharing of aggregate data very important while maintaining the confidentiality of the injured worker.\\n•\\tElectronic reporting of the data would enable OSHA to analyze the data in a more timely way.  OSHA estimates that more than 95% of small businesses have access to the internet to facilitate data submission. AOHP would support electronic data submission being a requirement.\\n\\nAOHP is a national association with more than 1,000 members who serve as leaders in championing the vital role of occupational health professionals in healthcare today. Through their active involvement at local, state and national levels, AOHP has become the defining resource and leading advocate for occupational health and safety in healthcare, representing tens of thousands of healthcare workers throughout the nation. AOHP promotes health and safety for healthcare workers through: advocacy; occupational health education and networking opportunities; health and safety advancement through best practice and research; and partnering with other invested stakeholders.\\n\\nIf you are in need of additional information, please contact MaryAnn Gruden, Association Community Liaison at 412-578-6792 or by email at magaohp@yahoo.com. Thank you again for the opportunity to comment on this proposed rulemaking.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n \\nDee Tyler, RN COHN-S FAAOHN\\nExecutive President',\n",

       "  and illness reporting requirements to add three new electronic \n",
       "  reporting obligations. At a public meeting on the proposal, many \n",
       "  stakeholders expressed concern that the proposal could motivate \n",
       "  employers to under-record their employees' injuries and illnesses. They \n",
       "  expressed concern that the proposal could promote an increase in \n",
       "  workplace policies and procedures that deter or discourage employees \n",
       "  from reporting work related injuries and illnesses. These include \n",
       "  adopting unreasonable requirements for reporting injuries and illnesses \n",
       "  and retaliating against employees who report injuries and illnesses. In \n",
       "  order to protect the integrity of the injury and illness data, OSHA is \n",
       "  considering adding provisions that will make it a violation for an \n",
       "  employer to discourage employee reporting in these ways. To facilitate \n",
       "  further evaluation of this issue, OSHA is extending the comment period \n",
       "  for 60 days for public comment on this issue. In promulgating a final \n",

       "  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: By notice published November 08, 2013, OSHA \n",
       "  proposed to amend its recordkeeping regulations to add requirements for \n",
       "  the electronic submission of injury and illness information that \n",
       "  employers are already required to keep. (78 FR 67254). The proposal \n",
       "  would require certain establishments that are already required to keep \n",
       "  injury and illness records under OSHA's regulations for recording and \n",
       "  reporting occupational injuries and illnesses to electronically submit \n",
       "  information from these records to OSHA. OSHA plans to post the \n",
       "  establishment-specific injury and illness data on its Web site.\n",
       "      On January 09-10, 2014, OSHA held a public meeting on the proposal. \n",
       "  A prevalent concern expressed by many meeting participants was that the \n",
       "  proposal might create motivations for employers to under-record \n",
       "  injuries and illnesses, since each covered establishment's injury and \n",
       "  illness data would become publically available on OSHA's Web site. Some \n",
       "  participants also commented that some employers already discourage \n",
       "  employees from making injury and illness reports by disciplining or \n",
       "  taking other adverse action against employees who file injury and \n",
       "  illness reports. These participants expressed concern that the \n",
       "  increased visibility of establishment injury and illness data under the \n",
       "  proposal would lead to an increase in the number of employers who adopt \n",
       "  practices that have the effect of discouraging employees from reporting \n",
       "  recordable injuries and illnesses. OSHA is concerned that the accuracy \n",
       "  of the data collected under the new proposal could be compromised if \n",
       "  employers adopt these practices. In addition, OSHA wants to ensure that \n",
       "  employers, employees, and the public have access to the most accurate \n",
       "  data about injuries and illnesses in their workplaces so that they can \n",
       "  take the most appropriate steps to protect worker safety and health.\n",
       "      Therefore, the Agency is seeking comment on whether to amend the \n",
       "  proposed rule to (1) require that employers inform their employees of \n",
       "  their right to report injuries and illnesses; (2) require that any \n",
       "  injury and illness reporting requirements established by the employer \n",
       "  be reasonable and not unduly burdensome; and (3) prohibit employers \n",
       "  from taking adverse action against employees for reporting injuries and \n",
       "  illnesses.\n",
       "      OSHA is particularly interested in the answers to the following \n",
       "  questions:\n",
       "      (1) What are the costs and benefits of OSHA using this rulemaking \n",
       "  to address the issue of employers who discourage employees from \n",
       "  reporting injuries and illnesses?\n",
       "      (2) Are the cost estimates in this document accurate?\n",
       "      (3) What other actions can OSHA take to address the issue of \n",
       "  employers who discourage employees from reporting injuries and \n",
       "  illnesses?\n",
       "      (4) How should OSHA clarify the requirement that injury and illness \n",
       "  reporting requirements established by the employer are reasonable and \n",
       "  not unduly burdensome?\n",
       "  \n",
       "  I. Legal Authority\n",
       "  \n",
       "      OSHA is issuing this proposal pursuant to authority expressly \n",
       "  granted by sections 8 and 24 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act \n",
       "  (the ``OSH Act'' or ``Act'') (29 U.S.C. 657, 673). Section 8(c)(2) of \n",
       "  the Act directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations ``requiring \n",
       "  employers to maintain accurate records of . . . work-related deaths, \n",
       "  injuries and illnesses,'' (29 U.S.C. 657(c)(2)), and section 8(g)(2) \n",
       "  broadly empowers the Secretary to ``prescribe such rules and \n",
       "  regulations as he may deem necessary to carry out [his] \n",
       "  responsibilities under this Act'' (29 U.S.C. 657(g)(2)). Similarly, \n",
       "  section 24 requires the Secretary to ``develop and maintain an \n",
       "  effective program of collection, compilation, and analysis of \n",
       "  occupational safety and health statistics'' and to ``compile accurate \n",
       "  statistics on work injuries and illnesses which shall include all \n",
       "  disabling, serious, or significant injuries and illnesses . . .'' (29 \n",
       "  U.S.C. 673(a)).\n",
       "      Rules that prohibit employers from discouraging employee reports of \n",
       "  injury and illness fit comfortably within these various statutory \n",
       "  grants of authority. If employers may not discipline or take adverse \n",
       "  action against workers for reporting injuries and illnesses, workers \n",
       "  will feel less hesitant to report their injuries and illnesses, and \n",
       "  their employers' records and reports will be more ``accurate'', as \n",
       "  required by sections 8 and 24 of the Act. Further, given testimony that \n",
       "  some employers already engage in such practices, and the possibility \n",
       "  that the proposed rule could provide additional motivation for \n",
       "  employers to do so, prohibiting employers from taking adverse actions \n",
       "  against their employees for reporting injuries and illnesses in this \n",
       "  rulemaking is ``necessary to carry out'' the\n",
       "  \n",
       "  [[Page 47607]]\n",
       "  \n",
       "  recordkeeping requirements of the Act. (See 29 U.S.C. 657(g)(2).).\n",
       "      Section 11(c) of the Act prohibits any person from discharging or \n",
       "  discriminating against any employee because that employee has exercised \n",
       "  any right under the Act. (29 U.S.C. 660(c)(1).) Under this provision, \n",
       "  an employee who believes he or she has been discriminated against may \n",
       "  file a complaint with OSHA, and if, after investigation, the Secretary \n",
       "  determines that Section 11(c) has been violated, then the Secretary can \n",
       "  file suit against the employer in U.S. District Court seeking ``all \n",
       "  appropriate relief'' including reinstatement and back pay. (29 U.S.C. \n",
       "  660(c)(2).) Taking adverse action against an employee who reports a \n",
       "  fatality, injury, or illness is a violation of 11(c), (see 29 CFR \n",
       "  1904.36); therefore, much of the primary conduct that would be \n",
       "  prohibited by the new provision is likely already proscribed by 11(c).\n",
       "      The advantage of this provision is that it would provide OSHA with \n",
       "  additional enforcement tools to promote the accuracy and integrity of \n",
       "  the injury and illness records employers are required to keep under \n",
       "  Part 1904. For example, under 11(c), OSHA may not act against an \n",
       "  employer unless an employee files a complaint. Under the additions to \n",
       "  the proposed rule under consideration, OSHA would be able to cite an \n",
       "  employer for taking adverse action against an employee for reporting an \n",
       "  injury or illness, even if the employee did not file a complaint. \n",
       "  Moreover, an abatement order can be a more efficient tool to correct \n",
       "  employer policies and practices than the injunctions authorized under \n",
       "  11(c).\n",
       "      The fact that Section 11(c) already provides a remedy for \n",
       "  retaliation does not preclude the Secretary from implementing \n",
       "  alternative remedies under the OSH Act. Where retaliation threatens to \n",
