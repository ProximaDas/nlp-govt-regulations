       " \n",
       "     Prior to the introduction of the Inpatient Prospective Payment \n",
       " System (IPPS) in 1983, hospital care was reimbursed on a cost basis. \n",
       " Beneficiaries who required closely supervised, resource intensive \n",

       " condition for which they were hospitalized, generally received these \n",
       " rehabilitation services as part of the same inpatient hospital stay \n",
       " that addressed their acute care needs. With the introduction of the \n",
       " prospective payment methodology, we developed Diagnostic Related Groups \n",
       " (DRGs) for classifying acute hospital stays. We found that DRGs did not \n",
       " fully address the variability of the rehabilitation portion of a \n",
       " hospital stay. Thus, in 1983, we established coverage for post-acute \n",
       " hospital level rehabilitation services that were excluded from the IPPS \n",
       " and reimbursed on a cost basis.\n",
       "     At that time, we established payment requirements that reimbursed \n",
       " rehabilitation units and free-standing rehabilitation hospitals as IRFs \n",
       " rather than as hospitals subject to the IPPS. The payment requirements \n",
       " governing free-standing IRFs can be found in Sec.  412.23. Similar \n",
       " requirements for hospital rehabilitation units classified as IRFs can \n",
       " be found in Sec.  412.29. To provide further guidance on our \n",

       "     The payment requirements and coverage policies that currently \n",

       " provide instructions for a small subset of providers furnishing \n",
       " intensive and complex therapy services in a fee-for-service environment \n",
       " to a small segment of patients whose rehabilitation needs could only be \n",
       " safely furnished at a hospital level of care. At that time about 350 \n",
       " IRFs were treating a relatively homogeneous patient group with similar \n",
       " health conditions and deficit levels, that is, approximately 54,000 \n",
       " Medicare patients per year being treated primarily for stroke and other \n",
       " severe neurological disorders. However, advances in health care \n",
       " technology and treatments, in combination with the 2002 introduction of \n",

       " approximately 400,000 Medicare cases per year for a broader range of \n",
       " conditions. By 2007, the types of cases being treated in IRFs had also \n",
       " become more heterogeneous as almost a third of IRF patients were \n",
       " treated for orthopedic, rather than neurological, conditions.\n",
       "     Rehabilitation services of varying intensity and duration are \n",
       " beneficial to beneficiaries with a broad range of conditions, but \n",
       " rehabilitation can be provided in a range of settings. It has become \n",
       " apparent that the existing IRF payment requirements and instructions do \n",
       " not always enable us to distinguish between patients who require \n",
       " complex, high intensity rehabilitation care in a hospital environment \n",
       " and those patients whose rehabilitation needs can be met in less \n",

       " physician orders that document the need for intensive rehabilitation \n",
       " services. Thus, we believe that a patient appropriate for admission to \n",

       " intensive rehabilitation program that is provided through a coordinated \n",
       " interdisciplinary team approach in an inpatient hospital setting. \n",

       " instead of ``multidisciplinary team'' (as is currently required at \n",
       " Sec.  412.23(b)(7) and Sec.  412.29(e)) more accurately reflects the \n",
       " care provided in an IRF. A multidisciplinary team approach to care \n",
       " requires only that clinicians representing various rehabilitation \n",
       " disciplines individually work with the patient to achieve an optimal \n",
       " level of functioning. However, with each clinician working \n",
       " independently, the patient loses the benefits of the coordinated care \n",
       " approach offered in IRFs.\n",
       "     In contrast, the interdisciplinary team approach to care requires \n",
       " that treating clinicians interact with each other and the patient to \n",
       " define a set of coordinated goals for the IRF stay and work together in \n",
       " a cooperative manner to deliver the services necessary to achieve these \n",

       " the patient to actively participate in an intensive rehabilitation \n",
       " program.\n",

       "     Another critical aspect of care provided in an IRF, versus another \n",
       " post-acute care setting, is that IRFs generally provide at least 3 \n",
       " hours of therapy per day at least 5 days per week. To conform to this \n",
       " standard, we propose (at Sec.  412.29(b)(1)(ii)) to require that \n",
       " patients generally require and reasonably be expected to actively \n",
       " participate in at least 3 hours of therapy per day at least 5 days per \n",
       " week, and be expected to make measurable improvement that will be of \n",
       " practical value to improve the patient's functional capacity or \n",

       " 412.29(b)(1)(ii)) to require that therapy treatments begin within 36 \n",
       " hours after the patient's admission to the IRF, to conform with IRF \n",
       " best practices and to ensure that the patient's care goals can be met.\n",
       "     Patients who are unwilling or unable to tolerate this intense level \n",
       " of therapy should be referred to another setting of care that is more \n",
       " appropriate to their medical needs, such as SNFs, long-term care \n",
       " hospitals, or home health agencies, where the patient can receive more \n",
       " appropriate levels of rehabilitation therapy and other forms of care.\n",
       "     At the same time, we recognize that a patient's condition may vary \n",
       " during the course of the stay. Therefore, in the MBPM we provide \n",
       " instructions on the procedures that should be followed to document \n",
       " cases in which therapy can be reduced or suspended for brief periods of \n",
       " time.\n",
       "     Also, we note that many IRF patients will medically benefit from \n",
       " more than 3 hours of therapy per day. Therefore, the 3 hour per day \n",
       " requirement is intended to be a minimum number of hours of therapy \n",
       " provided in an IRF, not a maximum. However, for the safety of the \n",
       " patient, we note that the intensity of therapy provided must never \n",
       " exceed the patient's level of tolerance or compromise the patient's \n",
       " safety.\n",
       "     In addition, while the requirement that IRFs ``ensure that the \n",
       " patients receive close medical supervision'' has been in effect since \n",
       " the mid-1980s, it has recently raised confusion among IRFs and Medicare \n",
       " contractors. Since this criterion currently found at 42 CFR \n",
       " 412.23(b)(4) and 412.29(c) has not been well-defined, it has been \n",
       " unclear how an IRF would document that close medical supervision was \n",
       " either needed by a patient or provided by the IRF. The need for \n",
       " physician supervision cannot be inferred retroactively from the \n",
       " presence or absence of an acute medical complication during the IRF \n",
       " stay. Similarly, the need for close medical supervision cannot \n",
       " generally be inferred from the presence or absence of frequent \n",
       " physician orders. Instead, we are proposing to include an evaluation of \n",
       " each patient's risk for clinical complications as part of the \n",
       " preadmission screening. Candidates for IRF admission should be assessed \n",
       " to ascertain the presence of risk factors requiring a level of \n",
       " physician supervision similar to the physician involvement generally \n",
       " expected in an acute inpatient environment, as compared with other \n",
       " settings of care. While the need for physician supervision will vary \n",
       " with each patient, we are proposing that the close medical supervision \n",
       " requirement would generally be met by having a rehabilitation \n",
       " physician, or other licensed treating physician with specialized \n",
       " training and experience in inpatient rehabilitation, conduct face-to-\n",
       " face visits with the patient a minimum of at least 3 days per week \n",
       " throughout the patient's stay. The purpose of the face-to-face visits \n",
       " is to assess the patient both medically and functionally, as well as to \n",
       " modify the course of treatment as needed to maximize the patient's \n",
       " capacity to benefit from the rehabilitation process.\n",
       "     It is critical to capture the preadmission screening information as \n",
       " closely as possible to the actual time of the IRF admission, so that \n",
       " the information provides a reliable picture of the patient's condition \n",
       " at the time of admission. For this reason, we propose to require (at \n",
       " Sec.  412.29(b)(2)(i)) that the preadmission screening be conducted by \n",
       " a qualified clinician(s) designated by a rehabilitation physician \n",
       " within the 48 hours immediately preceding the IRF admission, to give \n",
       " the most accurate picture of the patient upon admission to the IRF. \n",
       " Further, we are proposing to require (at Sec.  412.29(b)(2)(v)) that \n",
       " the preadmission screening documentation must be retained in the \n",
       " patient's medical record. We would expect that the reasons that the IRF \n",
       " clinical staff believe that the patient meets all of the required \n",
       " criteria for admission to the IRF would be included in the preadmission \n",
       " screening documentation. The MBPM will include more detailed \n",
       " instructions on the types of information required by the preadmission \n",
       " screening.\n",
       "     We are also proposing (at Sec.  412.29(b)(2)(iv)) to require that a \n",

       " ``rehabilitation physician,'' we mean a licensed physician with \n",

       " will be based on the best available information about the patient's \n",
       " condition.\n",
       "     Finally, since the proposed preadmission screening must be detailed \n",
       " and comprehensive for every patient, we do not believe that there will \n",

       "     As mentioned earlier in this proposed rule, we believe that \n",
       " interdisciplinary services, by definition, cannot be provided by only \n",
       " one discipline. The purpose of the interdisciplinary team meeting is to \n",
       " foster communication among disciplines to establish, prioritize, and \n",
       " achieve treatment goals.\n",
       "     Currently, we require team meetings at least once every two weeks. \n",
       " However, the length of many IRF stays has decreased significantly since \n",
       " this requirement was established. We believe that the biweekly meeting \n",
       " requirement is inadequate to ensure the appropriate establishment and \n",
       " achievement of treatment goals. Therefore, we propose at (Sec.  \n",
       " 412.29(d)(2)) to increase the required frequency of the \n",
       " interdisciplinary team meetings to at least once per week to reflect \n",
       " current best practices in IRFs.\n",
       "     Also, to improve the effectiveness and coordination of the care \n",
       " provided to IRF patients and to better reflect best practices in IRFs, \n",
       " we propose (at Sec.  412.29(d)(1)) to broaden the requirements \n",
       " regarding the professional staff that are expected to participate in \n",
       " the interdisciplinary team meetings. We propose that, at a minimum, the \n",
       " interdisciplinary team must consist of professionals from the following \n",
       " disciplines (each of whom must have current knowledge of the \n",
       " beneficiary as documented in the medical record):\n",
       "     <bullet> A rehabilitation physician with specialized training and \n",
       " experience in rehabilitation services;\n",
       "     <bullet> A registered nurse with specialized training or experience \n",
       " in rehabilitation;\n",
       "     <bullet> A social worker or a case manager (or both); and\n",
       "     <bullet> A licensed or certified therapist from each therapy \n",
       " discipline involved in treating the patient.\n",
       "     Although the purpose of the proposed requirement for \n",
       " interdisciplinary team meetings is to allow the exchange of information \n",
       " from all of the different disciplines involved in the patient's care, \n",
       " we believe that it is important to designate one person, specifically \n",
       " the rehabilitation physician, to be responsible for making the final \n",
       " decisions regarding the patient's IRF care. Thus, we are proposing to \n",
       " require (at Sec.  412.29(d)(3)) that the rehabilitation physician \n",
       " document concurrence with all decisions made by the interdisciplinary \n",
       " team at each meeting.\n",
       "     As discussed above, the interdisciplinary team must include \n",
       " registered nurses with training or experience in rehabilitation. We \n",
       " believe that 24-hour nursing care is both a key component of IRF care, \n",
       " and the normal standard of care in IRFs. Further, we believe that \n",
       " requiring registered nurses to have specialized training or experience \n",
       " is warranted considering that IRF patients typically have significant \n",
       " risk factors for medical complications that need to be monitored in an \n",
       " inpatient hospital environment. Thus, it is important to note that \n",
       " under proposed Sec.  412.29(a) the facility must be staffed to provide \n",
       " specialized nursing, regardless of whether any particular patient \n",
       " actually has a complication requiring specialized nursing.\n",
       "     Another critical aspect of IRF care is that rehabilitation therapy \n",
       " services are generally provided to each patient by a licensed or \n",
       " certified therapist working directly with the patient, more commonly \n",
       " known as one-on-one therapy. Anecdotally, we have heard that some IRFs \n",

       " believe that group therapies have a role in patient care in an IRF, but \n",
       " that they should be used in IRFs primarily as an adjunct to one-on-one \n",
       " therapy services, not as the main or only source of therapy services \n",

       " \n",

       " services generally provided in an IRF. To improve our understanding of \n",
       " when group therapy may be appropriate in IRFs, we specifically solicit \n",
       " comments on the types of patients for which group therapy may be \n",
       " appropriate, and the specific amounts of group instead of one-on-one \n",
       " therapies that may be beneficial for these types of patients. We \n",

       " significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. For \n",
       " purposes of the RFA, small entities include small businesses, nonprofit \n",
       " organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions. Most IRFs and most \n",
       " other providers and suppliers are small entities, either by nonprofit \n",
