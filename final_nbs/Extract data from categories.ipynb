       " SUMMARY: The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) proposes to amend \n",
       " its regulations governing small business contracting procedures. This \n",
       " Proposed Rule would amend part 127, that was promulgated in a Final \n",
       " Rule on October 1, 2008, and entitled ``The Women-Owned Small Business \n",
       " Federal Contract Assistance Procedures,'' RIN 3245-AF40. This Proposed \n",
       " Rule would implement procedures authorized by the Small Business Act \n",
       " (Act) (Pub. L. 85-536, as amended) to help ensure a level playing field \n",
       " on which Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSBs) can compete for Federal \n",
       " contracting opportunities. SBA proposes changes to part 127 that \n",
       " include eliminating the requirement for an agency-by-agency \n",
       " determination of discrimination, adopting both ``numbers'' and \n",
       " ``dollars'' measures of underrepresentation, and using the Fiscal Year \n",
       " 2006 Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as the data source \n",
       " for determining eligible industries under the WOSB Program. This \n",
       " Proposed Rule thus identifies the eligible industries under the Program \n",
       " as those industries in which WOSBs are underrepresented or \n",
       " substantially underrepresented using either the numbers or the dollars \n",
       " approach. This Proposed Rule seeks to retain, for the most part, parts \n",

       "     Therefore, on December 27, 2007, SBA published a new Proposed Rule, \n",

       "     In determining the eligible industries, the December 2007 Proposed \n",
       " Rule employed the full-sample 4-digit NAICS code dollars approach \n",
       " (using the dollar value of contract awards and the receipts of \n",
       " businesses) to identify the eligible industries under the WOSB Program. \n",
       " This approach identified four industries in which WOSBs were either \n",
       " underrepresented or substantially underrepresented. The comment period \n",
       " for the December 2007 Proposed Rule closed on March 31, 2008. SBA \n",
       " received approximately 1,720 comments on the proposed rule. Of the \n",
       " 1,720 comments received, 1,689 requested withdrawal of the Proposed \n",

       " Vendors do not input the business's revenues for each NAICS code listed \n",
       " or for each NAICS code in which it does business; rather, vendors input \n",
       " total revenues for the firm. Thus, CCR does not provide information \n",
       " concerning the revenue of a firm in each of the NAICS codes, or \n",
       " industries, it sets forth in its CCR registration. Therefore, when RAND \n",

       " contract. However, it is possible that a firm's inability to bid on \n",
       " Federal contracts, and therefore its reluctance to register on the CCR \n",

       "     <bullet> The SBO does not distinguish between WOSBs and women-owned \n",
       " businesses in general, large and small. The CCR, in contrast, contains \n",
       " self-reported information on whether a business is small. And the \n",
       " procedures authorized by section 8(m) are specifically targeted towards \n",
       " only small businesses owned by women.\n",
       "     <bullet> The SBO is generally not available for two years after the \n",

       " Proposed Rules and reconsidering the data and analysis in the RAND \n",
       " Report, SBA has determined that both of the remaining approaches, using \n",
       " numbers and dollars, are viable and appropriate means of identifying \n",
       " industries in which WOSBs are underrepresented or substantially \n",
       " underrepresented for purposes of section 8(m). Both approaches \n",
       " represent legitimate and complementary interpretations of the statutory \n",
       " term ``underrepresentation.'' SBA likewise believes that applying the \n",
       " section 8(m) program in these industries would reduce the effects of \n",
       " the discrimination affecting women-owned small businesses, consistent \n",
       " with Congress's goals, and that both numbers and dollars approaches are \n",

       " and identify the eligible industries under this Program as those \n",
       " industries in which WOSBs are underrepresented or substantially \n",
       " underrepresented using either the numbers or the dollars approach. SBA \n",
       " recognizes that this approach may enable competition restricted to \n",
       " WOSBs in industries where using only one or the other of the disparity \n",
       " measurement methodologies in the RAND study might not show \n",
       " underrepresentation of WOSBs in that industry. SBA therefore seeks \n",
       " comment on this proposed approach.\n",
       "     Section 8(m) instructs SBA to\n",
       " \n",
       " conduct a study to identify industries in which small business \n",
       " concerns owned and controlled by women are underrepresented with \n",

       " 15 U.S.C. 637(m)(4). The statute does not specify how \n",
       " underrepresentation should be identified, or state that only a single \n",
       " disparity measure can be used to identify underrepresentation. SBA must \n",
       " therefore determine the appropriate methods for identifying WOSB \n",
       " underrepresentation, recognizing that it is not bound to any one \n",
       " disparity measure to achieve that goal. As discussed above, the dollars \n",
       " approach compares the proportion of the dollar value of contracts in a \n",

       " receipts (revenues) in that NAICS code earned by WOSBs. The numbers \n",

       " the number of WOSBs in that particular NAICS code.\n",

       " underrepresented and substantially underrepresented.\n",

       " industry. This might occur if, for example, WOSBs were awarded \n",
       " contracts in numbers proportional to their numerical representation in \n",
       " an industry, but received much less in Federal contracting dollars than \n",
       " their non-WOSB counterparts. But underrepresentation can also occur \n",
       " where there is disparity in the number of contracts being awarded to \n",
       " WOSBs, even if there is no measured disparity in contract dollars, due \n",
       " to a handful of WOSBs winning large-dollar contracts. Indeed, as the \n",
       " RAND Report results show, during FY 2005, the top WOSB firm was awarded \n",
       " $673 million dollars in contracts, or 6 percent of the value of all \n",
       " Federal prime contracts awarded to WOSBs ($10.5 billion dollars). In \n",

       " awarded $2.1 billion, or 20 percent of Federal prime contracts going to \n",

       " the total volume of Federal contracts awarded to WOSBs for purposes of \n",

       " in which competition restricted to WOSBs will be authorized. Where \n",
       " different analytical methodologies yield different outcomes on the \n",
       " issue of WOSB underrepresentation in a particular industry, SBA must \n",

       " these methodologies in order to serve the statutory goal of improving \n",
       " WOSBs equal access to Federal contracting in those industries where \n",

       "  3. Appropriateness of Using the CCR Database\n",
       " \n",
       "     Comments on the prior Proposed Rules raised concerns about the RAND \n",
       " study's use of revenue data from the CCR database, concerns SBA noted \n",
       " in its withdrawn 2008 Final Rule. One concern centered on the way \n",
       " vendors, i.e., businesses registering for Federal contracts, input data \n",
       " into the CCR. As described above, the CCR database reflects each firm's \n",
       " total revenue in every NAICS code associated with the firm, rather than \n",
       " the amount of revenue associated with the particular NAICS code at \n",
       " issue. SBA noted in its 2007 Proposed Rule that this feature of the CCR \n",
       " data might result in overstating firms' revenues in some or all NAICS \n",
       " codes.\n",
       "     At least one commenter, in response to a prior version of the rule, \n",
       " asserted that the CCR data only takes into consideration current \n",
       " Federal contractors, whereas the SBO data could include all WOSB that \n",
       " are ready, willing and able to perform Federal work. A further \n",
       " potential viewpoint is that when using the SBO data set, the RAND Study \n",
       " found underrepresentation in a smaller number of industries, which \n",
       " could imply that women-owned firms were ``over-represented'' in \n",
       " numerous other industries in terms of the dollars of Federal \n",
       " procurement relative to their size in the economy. Consequently, it \n",
       " might be asserted that using the CCR data will allow set-asides in \n",
       " industries where other credible data (SBO data) show women-owned small \n",
       " businesses are not underrepresented in terms of Federal procurement.\n",
       "     Based on further analysis, SBA has concluded that the CCR data set \n",
       " is the best available data to use to determine the availability \n",
       " component of the disparity rations. First, the fact that the CCR \n",
       " database reflects each firm's total revenue in every NAICS code \n",
       " associated with the firm, rather than the amount of revenue associated \n",
       " with the particular NAICS code at issue, does not render unreliable the \n",
       " disparity ratios calculated using the dollars component of the CCR \n",
       " database.\\7\\ As previously discussed, the dollars-based disparity \n",
       " ratios are themselves based on a comparison between two different \n",
       " ratios: the value of the government contracts awarded to WOSBs in a \n",
       " particular industry compared to the value of all government contracts \n",
       " awarded in that industry, on the one hand; and the gross receipts (in \n",
       " the economy at large) of WOSBs registered in the CCR database for that \n",
       " industry compared to the gross receipts for all businesses registered \n",
       " for that industry, on the other. The numerator of this ratio--the value \n",
       " of government contracts awarded to WOSBs and to industries in general \n",
       " within a given industry code--is not calculated using the CCR database.\n",
       " ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
       " \n",
       "     \\7\\ This feature of the CCR database has no effect on disparity \n",
       " ratios calculated according to the numbers method, since that method \n",
       " does not make reference to firms' gross receipts.\n",
       " ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
       " \n",
       "     In addition, with respect to the denominator, SBA believes that it \n",
       " is reasonable to assume that WOSBs and non-WOSBs register in the CCR \n",
       " database and identify industries for which they are available in a \n",
       " similar manner. Thus, if a WOSB in a particular kind of business \n",
       " registers in (and effectively overstates its revenues in) three NAICS \n",
       " codes, a non-WOSB in the same kind of business is likely to register in \n",
       " (and overstate its revenues in) the same three NAICS codes. And because \n",
       " the denominator of the dollars-based disparity ratio is calculated \n",
       " based on a comparison between gross receipts earned by WOSBs and non-\n",
       " WOSBs, rather than the absolute values of those receipts, the potential \n",
       " over-reporting of revenue in each NAICS code does not raise serious \n",
       " concerns about the reliability of the dollars analysis of the RAND \n",
       " study.\n",
       "     SBA has also concluded the CCR database appropriately captures \n",
       " those firms ready, willing and able to compete for Federal contracts. \n",
       " The firms in the CCR database have indicated by registering to submit \n",
       " an offer on Federal prime contracts that they are ``willing'' to \n",
       " perform work on such contracts and have self-identified as firms that \n",
       " are ready and able to perform such work. RAND's review of the data \n",
       " identified no additional means of determining which firms are ready and \n",
       " able to work on these contracts.\\8\\ However, RAND ensured that the \n",
       " firms each had at least one employee as a ``proxy for `able.' '' RAND \n",
       " Study at 30. Further, because the SBO data generally considers all \n",
       " firms in the economy, it is possible that it may actually overestimate \n",
       " the number of firms that are ready, willing and able to perform Federal \n",
       " contracts, thus potentially overestimating underrepresentation.\n",
       " ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
       " \n",
       "     \\8\\ For instance, although size may be relevant to the ability \n",
       " to perform certain work, RAND found that small firms successfully \n",
       " competed for Federal contracts, and that it was not possible to \n",
       " identify a natural break point in contract size beyond which small \n",
       " businesses generally could not compete.\n",
       " ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
       " \n",
       "     Although the CCR data account for a firm's willingness to submit an \n",
       " offer and receive a Federal contract without also expressly accounting \n",
       " for firm qualifications or abilities, SBA believes that the CCR data is \n",
       " nevertheless an appropriate measure of firm availability. Although some \n",
       " contracting assistance programs may rely on actual bidder lists as the \n",
       " utilized measure of ready, willing, and able firms, see, e.g., Eng'g \n",

       " \n",
       "     SBA also proposes amending current Sec.  127.400 concerning \n",
       " eligibility examinations. The rule currently states that SBA will \n",
       " conduct an examination to determine eligibility at the time of the \n",
       " examination. However, the Act states that the Administrator shall \n",
       " establish procedures for verification of the accuracy of any \n",
       " certifications and those procedures may provide for program \n",
       " examinations, including random examinations. 15 U.S.C. 637(m)(5). It is \n",
       " clear that the examinations are to serve as a mechanism against fraud, \n",
       " waste and abuse in the program. Thus, SBA believes that the purpose of \n",
       " such examinations is broader, and that examinations should be used to \n",
       " verify eligibility at any time, including when an EDWOSB or WOSB \n",
       " certifies it is such a concern in ORCA, CCR, or at the time of offer or \n",
       " award of a contract. Therefore, SBA has amended this rule to explain \n",
       " that eligibility examinations will be used to verify eligibility at \n",
       " those times, as well.\n",
       "     In addition, this Proposed Rule states that SBA will conduct such \n",
       " examinations, as a way to combat fraud and abuse of the program. \n",
       " Further, as permitted by statute, SBA may adopt one or more various \n",
       " approaches from time to time and as appropriate by the circumstances \n",
       " when determining which WOSBs or EDWOSBs to examine. This may include \n",
       " the utilization of robust random sampling, as well as higher levels of \n",
       " random examinations of WOSBS or EDWOSBs that have received the most \n",
       " contracts or most contract dollars during any applicable period. \n",
       " Further, SBA may decide to conduct examinations when it has received \n",
       " credible information that certain WOSBS or EDWOSBs do not meet the \n",
       " eligibility criteria of the WOSB Program.\n",
       "     As part of these examinations, the WOSB or EDWOSB must submit \n",
       " documents to verify its eligibility. Specifically, this Proposed Rule \n",
       " requires WOSBs and EDWOSBs to submit documents to verify eligibility, \n",
       " including those submitted under proposed Sec.  127.300(c), as well as \n",
       " copies of proposals or bids submitted in response to an EDWOSB or WOSB \n",
       " solicitation. In addition, EDWOSBs will be required to submit the two \n",
       " most recent personal income tax returns (including all schedules and W-\n",
       " 2 forms) for the women claiming economic disadvantage and their spouses \n",

       " SBA may be able to obtain those documents from the third-party \n",
       " certifier or the contracting officer's contract file.\n",
       "     However, because the examination may look at eligibility at the \n",
       " time of certification in ORCA, this Proposed Rule requires that WOSBs \n",

       " [[Page 10043]]\n",
       " \n",
       " that this requirement would frustrate Congressional intent by applying \n",

       " determination of discrimination requirement exceeds what would be \n",
       " required even under the strict scrutiny standard applicable to \n",
       " classifications based on race and national origin. The comments further \n",
       " state that the requirement would inappropriately limit the industries \n",
       " in which WOSBs were recognized as underrepresented or substantially \n",
       " underrepresented. Lastly, the comments state that this requirement \n",
       " would substantially burden the procuring agencies and that the \n",
       " procuring agencies would avoid fulfilling the goals of the program to \n",
       " avoid self-incrimination and litigation.\n",
       "     Based on these comments and further analysis, SBA agrees that an \n",

       "     First, the equal protection requirements of the Fifth Amendment \n",

       " Regulatory Impact Analysis\n",
       " 1. Necessity of Regulation\n",
       "     This regulatory action implements section 8(m) of the Act, which \n",
       " was enacted as part of section 811 of the Small Business \n",
       " Reauthorization Act of 2000, Public Law 106-554. Section 8(m) \n",

       " described in this regulation. Under this regulation, contracting \n",

       " \n",
       " [[Page 10044]]\n",
       " \n",
       " allowed to restrict competition to EDWOSBs in industries in which SBA \n",
       " has determined that WOSBs are underrepresented or substantially \n",
       " underrepresented and to WOSBs in industries in which SBA has determined \n",
       " that WOSBs are substantially underrepresented and waived the \n",
       " economically disadvantaged requirement. This Proposed Rule will \n",
       " establish the requirements and procedures necessary to administer these \n",
       " restricted competitions.\n",
       " 2. Alternative Approaches to Proposed Rule\n",
       "     In developing this Proposed Rule, SBA considered the costs and \n",
       " benefits of alternatives for certification of small business concerns \n",
       " that claim EDWOSB or WOSB status, particularly the alternatives \n",
       " provided by section 8(m) of the Act. Specifically, section 8(m)(2)(F) \n",
       " provides that in order to qualify as a WOSB or EDWOSB, a concern must \n",
       " either be certified by a Federal agency, a State government, or a \n",
       " national certifying entity approved by the Administrator, or, \n",
       " alternatively, must certify to the contracting officer that it is a \n",
       " small business concern owned and controlled by women and provide \n",
       " supporting documents. In light of this provision, SBA considered \n",
       " performing the certifications by requiring each concern to submit a \n",
       " formal application to SBA for a determination of its status. That \n",
       " approach, however, is not required or intended by the statute or \n",
       " legislative history.\n",
       "     In addition, SBA considered utilizing third-party certifiers. For \n",
       " the reasons set forth in the preamble, SBA has decided to propose the \n",
       " use of such third-party certifiers. SBA believes that the proposed \n",
       " process would be the most beneficial and cost-effective approach for \n",
       " the small business concerns because they will not have to submit formal \n",
       " applications to SBA to become eligible for restricted competition for \n",
       " WOSB and EDWOSB procurements.\n",
       "     In this Proposed Rule, SBA has proposed the use of an ORCA \n",
       " certification and document submission process, which is similar to the \n",
       " one that is used in other existing SBA set-aside programs. For example, \n",
       " SBA's program for small businesses permits those concerns to self-\n",
       " represent their size when submitting offers on Federal contracts. The \n",
       " set-aside program for small businesses has worked well for decades. SBA \n",
       " believes that the certification process proposed in this rule is \n",
       " credible because it supported by robust protest procedures as well as \n",
       " eligibility examinations. In addition, the business concern must \n",
       " provide documents verifying its eligibility.\n",
       "     SBA did consider another option with respect to the submission of \n",
       " documents to the contracting officer. As discussed in the preamble \n",
       " above, the Act states that a WOSB or EDWOSB can certify to the \n",
       " contracting officer that it is such an entity and must provide \n",
       " supporting documents to the contracting officer verifying its \n",
       " eligibility. This Proposed Rule requires the WOSB or EDWOSB to submit \n",
       " certain documents to the contracting officer via an electronic \n",
       " repository at the time of initial certification in ORCA and then every \n",
       " year after that. In addition, WOSBs and EDWOSBs must also provide \n",
       " updated documents anytime there is a change that necessitates \n",
       " supplementing the original document submission. In the alternative, if \n",
       " the repository is not available, the WOSB or EDWOSB must submit those \n",
       " documents directly to the contracting officer prior to the award of a \n",
       " WOSB or EDWOSB contract. SBA did consider having the EDWOSB or WOSB \n",
       " provide all necessary documents to the contracting officer at the time \n",
       " of award in order to verify eligibility of the awardee (e.g., tax \n",
       " returns, resumes). However, SBA believes this may be a burden on both \n",
       " the small business and contracting community and therefore did not \n",
       " propose this alternative. SBA is still exploring the feasibility of all \n",
       " of these approaches and has requested comments from the public on all \n",
       " of them and any other the public may have.\n",
       "     SBA also considered alternative data sets and measures of \n",
       " disparity. SBA proposes to use the CCR database and both numbers and \n",
       " dollars approaches for the reasons set forth in the preamble but \n",
       " solicits comments on this approach.\n",
       " 3. What Are the Potential Benefits and Costs of This Regulatory Action?\n",
       "     This rule directs benefits to EDWOSBs and WOSBs at a cost to \n",
       " concerns ineligible for the program. In addition, this rule may result \n",
       " in new administrative costs of managing a Federal contracting \n",
       " assistance program. However, SBA believes that these costs are \n",
       " significantly outweighed by the benefits to be gained by reducing the \n",
       " inefficiencies caused by discriminatory barriers that currently impede \n",
       " WOSBs' full participation in the Federal contracting market.\n",
       "     Any concern about an increase in product or service cost is \n",
       " balanced by the requirement in the statute and Proposed Rule that any \n",
       " contract award under the WOSB Program be made at a fair and reasonable \n",
       " price. Further, there will not be any additional cost associated with \n",
       " the length of the procurement since the process will not be any longer, \n",
       " and could in some instances be shorter, than would be the case in the \n",
       " absence of the WOSB program. Finally, the creation and development of \n",
       " WOSBs could well, over time, result in enhanced bidding for Federal \n",
       " contracts, ultimately resulting in lower costs of contracts for the \n",
       " Federal government.\n",
       "     This rule aims to aid EDWOSBs and WOSBs by enabling contracting \n",
       " officers to restrict competition to EDWOSBs in industries in which SBA \n",
       " has determined that WOSBs are underrepresented and substantially \n",
       " underrepresented and to WOSBs in industries in which SBA has determined \n",
       " that WOSBs are substantially underrepresented where certain threshold \n",
       " determinations are made by an agency. It is difficult to estimate the \n",
       " total number of potential beneficiaries that will be eligible for \n",
       " Federal small business assistance as a result of this Proposed Rule. \n",
       " Utilizing the RAND FPDS/NG data set for the total number of WOSBs \n",
       " (identified by Dun and Bradstreet DUNS number) that received obligated \n",
       " funds from awards, contracts, orders and modifications to existing \n",
       " contracts for FY 2005, approximately 12,000 WOSBs were identified as \n",
       " recipients of Federal contracts in the 83 NAICS codes that would be \n",
       " eligible under the WOSB Program. It is expected that the number of \n",
       " awards to EDWOSBs and WOSBs will increase within these NAICS codes \n",
       " should an agency restrict competition to those groups in accordance \n",
       " with the procedures in this Proposed Rule.\n",
       "     To the extent that additional firms become active in government \n",
       " programs, additional administrative costs to the Federal government may \n",
       " arise due to additional bidders for Federal small business procurement \n",
       " programs, additional firms seeking SBA guaranteed lending programs, and \n",
       " additional firms eligible for enrollment in SBA's Dynamic Small \n",
       " Business Search data base. Among businesses in this group seeking SBA \n",
       " assistance, there will be some additional costs associated with \n",
       " compliance and verification associated with certification of small \n",
       " business status and protests of small business status. However, these \n",
       " activities are likely to generate minimal incremental costs since \n",
       " mechanisms are currently in place to handle these administrative \n",
       " requirements.\n",
       "     In addition, as more EDWOSBs and WOSBs enter into the Federal \n",
       " arena, competition will likely increase, lowering the cost of the \n",
       " program and ultimately, we hope, eliminating\n",
       " \n",
       " [[Page 10045]]\n",
       " \n",
       " underrepresentation within the industries covered by this Proposed Rule \n",
       " and the industry's participation in the program. In the long run, small \n",
       " business opportunities--and the amount of competition in the Federal \n",
       " procurement market as a whole--will be enhanced by the experience WOSBs \n",
       " gain in Federal contracting through participation in this Program. \n",
       " While WOSBs gain this experience, moreover, this Rule ensures that any \n",
       " contract award to them will be based on a fair and reasonable price to \n",
       " the government. Indeed, the current barriers that inhibit WOSBs' \n",
       " ability to compete equally for contracts and subcontracts impose upon \n",
       " the government increased costs due to lessened competition; these costs \n",
       " are likely to be reduced as more WOSBs become economically successful \n",
       " and competition for contracts and subcontracts therefore increases.\n",
       "     This regulatory action promotes the government's objectives. One of \n",
       " SBA's goals is to help individual small businesses succeed through fair \n",
       " and equitable access to capital and credit, government contracts, and \n",
       " management and technical assistance. Implementation of this Proposed \n",
       " Rule ensures that the intended beneficiaries have access to small \n",
       " business programs designed to assist them. This Proposed Rule does not \n",
       " interfere with State, local, and tribal governments in the exercise of \n",
       " their government functions. In a few instances, in fact, State and \n",
       " local governments have voluntarily adopted SBA's regulations for their \n",
       " programs; those state and local governments that do so here will save \n",
       " resources that otherwise would be consumed by the need to establish \n",
       " their own administrative standards and processes.\n",
       "     This regulatory action will also enable the Federal government to \n",

       " SBA has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) \n",
       " addressing the impact of this Rule in accordance with section 603, \n",
       " title 5, of the United States Code. The IRFA examines the objectives \n",
       " and legal basis for this Proposed Rule; the kind and number of small \n",

       " duplicate, overlap, or conflict with this Proposed Rule; and whether \n",
       " there are any significant alternatives to this Proposed Rule.\n",
       " 1. What Are the Reasons for, and Objectives of, This Proposed Rule?\n",
       "     SBA is establishing procedures whereby Federal procuring agencies \n",
       " may use restricted competition in industries where WOSBs are \n",
       " substantially underrepresented, or, in some cases, underrepresented in \n",
       " Federal procurement and when certain other conditions are met. The \n",
       " purpose of this Proposed Rule is to create an initial framework and \n",
       " infrastructure for implementing these new procedures, thereby providing \n",
       " a tool for Federal agencies to ensure that WOSBs have an equal \n",
       " opportunity to participate in Federal contracting. The objectives of \n",
       " this Proposed Rule are to overcome the effects of sex discrimination on \n",
       " women's opportunities to participate equally in Federal contracting, to \n",
       " ensure a level playing field on which women-owned small businesses have \n",
       " a fair opportunity to compete for Federal contracts, and to ensure that \n",
       " the WOSB Program is substantially related to the Congressional goals in \n",
       " accordance with applicable law.\n",
       " 2. What Is the Legal Basis for This Proposed Rule?\n",
       "     SBA is proposing this regulation pursuant to section 8(m) of the \n",
       " Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(m), which authorizes the creation and \n",
       " implementation of a new mechanism for Federal contracting with WOSBs.\n",
       " 3. What Is SBA's Description and Estimate of the Number of Small \n",
       " Entities to Which the Rule Will Apply?\n",
       "     The RFA directs agencies to provide a description, and where \n",
       " feasible, an estimate of the number of small business concerns that may \n",
       " be affected by the rule. This Proposed Rule will ultimately establish \n",
       " in the FAR a new procurement mechanism to benefit WOSBs. Therefore, \n",
       " WOSBs that compete for Federal contracts are the specific group of \n",
       " small business concerns most directly affected by this rule. The rule \n",
       " may also affect other small businesses to the extent that small \n",
       " businesses not owned and controlled by women may be excluded from \n",
       " competing for certain Federal contracting opportunities.\n",
       "     SBA searched CCR's DSBS and determined that there were \n",
       " approximately 76,000 WOSBs listed. However, it is not likely that all \n",
       " of these firms will be affected by this rule because not all of these \n",
       " firms likely do business in one of the 83 four-digit NAICS codes \n",
       " identified as underrepresented or substantially underrepresented by the \n",
       " Proposed Rule. SBA attempted to approximate the number of WOSBs in the \n",
       " 83 industries, but there is no simple method of determining how many \n",
       " firms actually participated in these NAICS codes. SBA did review the \n",
       " DSBS to determine that, as of June 30, 2009, there were approximately \n",
       " 230,005 WOSBs identified in the 83 industries that will be eligible for \n",
       " contract assistance under the WOSB Program. However, this approach \n",
       " counted a WOSB multiple times if it listed itself in more than one \n",
       " NAICS code, and therefore likely overstates the number of WOSBs that \n",
       " will be affected by this rule. Therefore, the best estimate of the \n",
       " maximum number of currently registered WOSBs that could be affected by \n",
       " this rule is approximately 76,000. However, there may be more WOSBs \n",
       " affected if additional firms list themselves in DSBS or if SBA approves \n",
       " additional industries for set-aside procurements under these \n",
       " procedures. However, the number could be less because many otherwise-\n",
       " qualified EDWOSBs and WOSBs will not find it advantageous to \n",
       " participate in the WOSB Program, since the industries in which they do \n",
       " business are not one of the 83 eligible industries.\n",
       "     This Proposed Rule would affect small businesses other than WOSBs \n",
       " that are excluded from competition for Federal contracts that are \n",
       " included in the Program. Non-WOSBs in the 83 designated industries may \n",
       " be excluded from opportunities from which they would have otherwise \n",
       " benefited. However, the Federal government purchases billions of \n",
       " dollars of goods and services every year, and SBA believes that there \n",
       " are sufficient acquisitions available for all small businesses. \n",
       " Therefore, the number of small businesses that could be excluded under \n",
       " the proposed determination of eligible industries or future such \n",
       " determinations is not known at this time.\n",
       "     Additional contracting opportunities identified by Federal agencies \n",
       " as candidates for the WOSB program will come from new contracting \n",
       " requirements and contracts currently performed by small and large \n",
       " businesses. At this time, SBA cannot accurately predict how the \n",
       " existing distribution of contracts by business type may change by this \n",
       " rule.\n",
       " 4. What Are the Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, Paperwork Reduction \n",
       " Act and Other Compliance Requirements?\n",
       "     WOSBs are not required to be certified as such in order to contract \n",
       " with the Federal Government; this will still be true if this Proposed \n",
       " Rule is adopted. For a WOSB to be eligible for Federal contracts \n",
       " restricted to WOSBs or EDWOSBs, however, it will have to self-certify \n",
       " its status as a WOSB in ORCA and CCR. Any WOSB or EDWOSB that is the \n",
       " apparent successful offeror will have to provide certain documents to \n",
       " the contracting officer, prior to award, to verify its eligibility. \n",
       " This procedure is required by statute. This requirement ensures that \n",
       " participation in certain contracting opportunities is restricted to \n",
       " qualified WOSBs according to the terms of section 8(m) of the Act and \n",
       " the criteria in this Proposed Rule. In addition, concerns would have to \n",
       " submit information to SBA in the context of a protest or examination. \n",
       " In the case of a protest or examination, SBA might request that a \n",
       " particular WOSB submit documentation to substantiate its claim. WOSBs \n",
       " or EDWOSBs are required to retain documentation demonstrating \n",
       " satisfaction of the eligibility requirements for six (6) years from \n",
       " date of self-certification in ORCA. SBA proposes to require the \n",
       " documents be kept for six (6) years from the date of a self-\n",
       " certification because the government can bring an action under 31 \n",
       " U.S.C. 3730 for false claims six (6) years from the date the false \n",
       " claim is made. 31 U.S.C. 3731.\n",
       "     The proposed document retention will require WOSBs and EDWOSBs to\n",
       " \n",
       " [[Page 10047]]\n",
       " \n",
       " have a filing system to retain the documents; however, SBA believes \n",
       " this information is already retained by a WOSB or EDWOSB in the \n",
       " ordinary course of business. Therefore this Proposed Rule will not \n",
       " likely impose any additional burden on WOSBs and EDWOSBs. To the extent \n",
       " that WOSBs and EDWOSBs typically retain this information for less than \n",
       " six (6) years, the concern may have to increase the capacity of its \n",
       " filing and document tracking system.\n",
       "     In addition, any documents submitted to a contracting officer as \n",
       " part of an offer are considered source selection sensitive under FAR \n",
       " and cannot be released prior to award of a contract. 48 CFR 3.104-3. \n",
       " After award of a contract, all information and/or documents submitted \n",
       " to a Federal agency, including SBA, are protected to the fullest extent \n",
       " permitted by law, including the Privacy Act and Freedom of Information \n",
       " Act, 5 U.S.C. 552.\n",
       "     The Paperwork Reduction Act requirements are addressed further \n",
       " below. SBA would welcome any comments on the process as described.\n",
       " 5. What Relevant Federal Rules May Duplicate, Overlap, or Conflict With \n",
       " This Rule?\n",
       "     SBA has not identified any relevant Federal rules currently in \n",
       " effect that duplicate or conflict with this rule. The restricted-\n",
       " competition feature of the WOSB program will be an addition to the \n",
       " existing contracting programs that agencies currently administer, such \n",
       " as small business set-asides, HUBZone set-asides, service-disabled \n",
       " veteran-owned small business set-asides, and contracts reserved for the \n",
       " 8(a) Business Development Program. For any particular contract, a \n",
       " contracting officer may have a range of set-aside options from which to \n",
       " select. Because any contract awarded to a WOSB will also count towards \n",
       " an agency's small business goal, these procedures may lead a \n",
       " contracting officer to select this program in lieu of another.\n",
       "     Therefore, although there may be some overlap, the addition of the \n",
       " set-aside mechanism for women-owned small business should complement \n",
       " rather than conflict with the goals of existing set-aside programs.\n",
       " 6. What Significant Alternatives Did SBA Consider That Accomplish the \n",
       " Stated Objectives and Minimize Any Significant Economic Impact on Small \n",
       " Entities?\n",
       "     The RFA requires agencies to identify alternatives to the rule in \n",
       " an effort to minimize any significant economic impact of the rule on \n",
       " small entities. SBA has determined that this rule may have a \n",
       " significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. \n",
       " This rule will implement the set-aside mechanism for WOSBs, as \n",
       " established by section 8(m) of the Act. All of the provisions of this \n",
       " rule reflect requirements under that statute.\n",
       "     The legislation does provide SBA with alternative approaches, \n",
       " however, for the certification of WOSBs. Specifically, a WOSB may be \n",
       " certified by a Federal agency, a State government, or a national \n",
       " certifying entity approved by the Administrator. SBA has reviewed some \n",
       " sources and believes that such certification is different depending on \n",
       " the location and size of the business and that the range for such a \n",
       " certification is approximately $200-$1000 for the initial certification \n",
       " and every year thereafter for recertification. In some cases, the costs \n",
       " may be higher. Thus, the WOSB may, in the alternative, self-certify in \n",
       " ORCA and provide adequate documentation to the contracting officer (via \n",
       " an electronic repository or directly to the contracting officer if the \n",
       " repository is unavailable) that it is a WOSB in accordance with \n",
       " standards established by the Administration, with minimal costs (to \n",
       " include document retention). SBA did consider limiting certification to \n",
       " either third party certification or self-certification with the \n",
       " provision of documents, but SBA believes that this Proposed Rule \n",
       " provides the most flexibility to WOSBs and EDWOSBs in participating in \n",
       " the program. SBA estimates that implementation of this regulation will \n",
       " require no additional proposal costs for WOSBs, as compared to \n",
       " submitting proposals under any other small business set-aside program. \n",
       " Moreover, WOSBs currently represent their status for purposes of data \n",

       " although WOSBs or EDWOSBs must make available documentation to the \n",
       " contracting officer at the time of certification in ORCA, the documents \n",
       " provided are kept in the normal course of business and therefore should \n",
