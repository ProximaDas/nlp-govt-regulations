       " \"January 19, 2016 Regulations Divisions Office of General Council Department of Housing and Urban Development 451 7th Street SW, Room 10276 Washington, DC 20410 - 0500 Docket No. FR 5597-P-02, RIN 2577-AC97 Instituting Smoke-Free Public Housing  On behalf of The Center for Health Affairs, a hospital trade association representing 36 acute care providers in Northeast Ohio, I am pleased to provide comments on the proposed rule by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to institute smoke-free public housing.  Hospitals in Northeast Ohio have long supported policies which promote healthy lifestyles and preventive measures to avoid chronic diseases. As the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, lung cancer takes thousands of lives too early each year. Instituting smoke-free housing is an opportunity to improve living conditions for millions of families residing in public housing, significantly limiting their exposure to the harmful effects of smoking.  The proposed rule would impact roughly 1.2 million housing units across the country and help to improve the health of more than 760,000 children who currently live in those units. As a result, healthcare costs are estimated to decrease by $153 million annually once smoke-free housing policies are fully implemented. In addition to saving countless lives and promoting healthy living, a smoke-free policy reduces the potential for fire hazards, which caused 17,600 residential fires resulting in 490 civilian deaths, 1,370 injuries and $516 million in direct property damage in recent years. While The Center strongly supports policies to curb tobacco use, we offer suggestions with regard to HUD's implementation of this policy to ensure unintended consequences do not negatively impact the residents subject to these changes. As it relates to enforcement, the penalties associated with this policy should carefully assess the potential for residents to become displaced or homeless should they not comply with the rule. It is well documented that low-income families have limited resources and mobility with regard to housing and, as such, HUD should safeguard against the possibility that penalties will result in displacement.  Given the highly addictive nature of nicotine, quitting smoking is tremendously challenging for many long-time tobacco users. While this policy, in its most strict interpretation, is designed to create safer environments for residents by removing smoke from living quarters, we recommend the broader public health goal of reducing overall tobacco use not be forgotten. Residents who are tobacco users should be offered opportunities, support groups or programs to help fight their addiction and sustain from smoking. Many of our member hospitals have for decades offered smoking cessation programs free of charge to their employees and patients who are in the process of giving up tobacco. The Center recommends that HUD consider using funds to develop programs to help tobacco users stop their consumption once and for all, ensuring future generations have a greater chance of avoiding the dangers of lung cancer. The Center for Health Affairs and its member hospitals offer their strong support for this rule. Improving the living conditions for over a million families residing in public housing units through public health initiatives such as this guarantees a healthier future for many. As a result, we believe future generations will have opportunities that may have otherwise been taken from them under the current circumstances. Thank you for the opportunity to share our comments on this very important issue.  Regards,   Bill Ryan President & CEO \",\n",
       " 'Comments on Instituting Smoke-Free Public Housing (Docket No. FR 5597-P-02)  \\tI respectfully submit these comments in support of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\\'s proposed rule establishing smoke-free public housing.1  The proposed rule would require public housing agencies (PHAs) to \"design and implement a policy prohibiting the use of lit tobacco products in all public housing living units and interior common areas ... as well as in outdoor areas within 25 feet from public housing and administrative office buildings.\"    \\tThe benefits of a policy prohibiting smoking are substantial.  A smoke-free housing environment improves air quality and reduces exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS).  It is unquestionable that exposure to SHS is dangerous and causes death and serious disease, and that the only way to eliminate exposure is to eliminate smoking in indoor spaces.  The Surgeon General established that other methods, including separating smokers and nonsmokers, do not work.  A policy prohibiting smoking would also reduce the risk of deadly fires and significantly lower maintenance costs.  It is clear that HUD already has a record on which to move forward.     \\tThe significant outstanding issue is enforcement.  The key challenge for HUD and PHAs will be developing the appropriate enforcement mechanisms.  For the residents who are addicted to smoking or who may use it as a coping mechanism the costs are high and may include eviction.  These costs and the privacy rights of smokers should not be minimized but smoking is not a private behavior in multiunit housing.  Society must therefore balance the interests of smokers and others.  The health and safety risks to all residents are too great not to adopt a smoke-free policy.   \\tThe experience of PHAs is invaluable, particularly their experience with \"graduated enforcement\" and other enforcement mechanisms, and that experience should continue to shape HUD\\'s proposal.  As HUD notes, more than 500 PHAs have already implemented smoke-free policies and earlier PHA input has shaped the proposed rule.  The recently adopted policy of the Philadelphia Housing Authority, the largest public housing agency to adopt a smoke-free policy, may serve as a model in several respects.  The Housing Authority worked cooperatively with residents on implementation issues, and its enforcement measures prioritize cessation programs and education over eviction for violations.  Tenants in existing units will never be evicted.  Tenants in new or substantially rehabilitated units may face eviction but only after the fourth violation.  The Housing Authority will reevaluate its approach after nine months.    \\tAnd, of course, the input of residents is critical.  While HUD proposes that PHAs amend their PHA plans, which may require public meetings, HUD should make meaningful resident engagement and input a requirement.    \\tIn a thoughtful article on \"Indoor Smoking Regulations in Public Housing,\" which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Winickoff, Gotlieb and Mello address the potential impact of a smoke-free policy on tenants who smoke.  They conclude that the \"same legal, practical, and health issues that have driven successful efforts to make workplaces, private vehicles, and private housing smoke-free mitigate in favor of extending similar protection to the vulnerable public housing population.\" The article responds to the privacy rights argument, noting that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments \"provides only the most minimal level of protection for smoking.\"    \\tThe best way to create a smoke-free environment is to help smokers quit.  As Winickoff et al. note, it \"is critical that no-smoking policies be accompanied by provision of evidence-based smoking cessation resources.\"  And they frame the issue as HUD does - a smoke-free environment does not mean that smokers should be banned, just the activity of smoking should be banned.  They state that \"ethical concerns can be minimized by prohibiting not the occupation of public housing units by people who smoke tobacco but the act of smoking on the premises.\"  \\tAnd with the emphasis properly directed to helping smokers quit, it might be premature to include e-cigarettes in the rule.  As smokers may be able to use e-cigarettes as part of a cessation program, HUD might want to wait until the impacts are better known.     \\tIt is unquestionable that a smoke-free housing policy is warranted given the dangers of exposure to secondhand smoke.  HUD should focus its attention on designing the appropriate enforcement mechanism.  The objective is a smoke-free environment, not the eviction of tenants who smoke.

       " \"I am in complete support of this proposed rule.  It's only short fall is that it does not include e-cigarettes.  There are a number of benefits of implementing a Smoke-Free policies into multi-unit housing complexes.  They include, but are not limited to:  1.  Clean up costs once a smoker vacates the unit is decreased significantly. 2.  Decreased insurance premiums due to decreased fire risk (depending on the insurance company) 3.  Fellow residents would not be exposed to secondhand smoke, as smoke drifts through shared ventilation systems and windows 4.  Healthier environment for all that reside there.

       " 'Thank you for the opportunity to provide comment.  The Coalition for a Tobacco-Free Hawaii (CTFH) is a program of the Hawaii Public Health Institute (HIPHI) that is dedicated to reducing tobacco use through education, policy, and advocacy.  With nearly two decades of history in Hawaii, the Coalition has led several campaigns on enacting smoke-free environments, including being the first state in the nation to prohibit the sale of tobacco and electronic smoking devices to purchasers under 21 years of age.   HIPHI applauds HUD\\'s initiative to require all public housing agencies (PHA) to implement smoke-free policies. Furthermore, HIPHI strongly supports a mandate (as opposed to a voluntary approach), that aims to protect all public housing residents from the dangers of secondhand and thirdhand smoke.  In response to the proposed rule, HIPHI respectfully recommends the following: 1.\\tExpand the definition of \"lit tobacco products\" to include electronic smoking devices and hookahs. 2.\\tInclude language that identifies all indoor, outdoor, and enclosed \"restricted areas\" and exempt parking lots as a designated smoking area.   Additionally, the attached document includes a brief summary of experiences and lessons learned from our State efforts to address smoke-free public housing, and suggestions for how HUD can support PHAs as they transition toward smoke-free living.

Has there been further discussion concerning the reasonable accommodation process if a no smoking policy is implemented for PHAs?  In agreement with HUD, I strongly encourage a complete and comprehensive no smoking policy.  During the 18 month implementation phase, PHAs will have the option when to phase entire portfolio within the 18 months?  What other discussions have occurred concerning how PHAs converting to RAD properties implement the no smoking policy?',\n",
       " 'We, at the Housing Authority of the City of Teague, have already implemented a smoke free policy for our property.  However, I do not see the \"25 ft from any building\" rule to be enforceable.  Our policy states that residents can smoke on uncovered porches.  We have some designated elderly properties.  If we had to enforce a 25 foot rule, I foresee possibly evicting elderly tenants for breaking that rule.  It is hard enough to obtain an eviction ruling on smoking policy violations; I would hate to have to try to explain to a small town Justice of the Peace that we are evicting for smoking across the street.

The process was initiated 18 months in advance and our agency was had discretion in implementation, compliance, and enforcement. This proposed rule eliminates that discretion entirely.  The proposed rule would require an agency such as ours to completely rewrite, implement and enforce a wholly new policy in order to be in compliance with the 25' rule.  We would ask for some discretion in the setback requirements, or to be grandfathered and allowed to enforce the policy we already have in place, that is working well and has the support of our residents and stakeholders alike.\",\n",

It is the mission of all PHAs to provide safe and afforadable housing to low-income families.   Second hand smoke has been proven to cause death.   I think if we DID NOT implement and enforce Non-Smoking Policy, we would not be able to meet the mission of providing \"safe\" housing. I am a former smoker.

       " 'Smoking a legal product in one\\'s residence should be a minimal concern to HUD, especially when there are actually legitimate threats many residents of HUD housing need to be concerned with. Pardon the pun, but this seems to be a \"smoke screen\" to make it appear that HUD has genuine concern for its residents. In reality, HUD is pushing to make it easier for convicted criminals to move into their properties, and that is a legitimate safety concern.  If HUD properties are frequently subject to cigarette smoke or e-cigarette vapor permeating walls into neighboring residences, then perhaps HUD should focus on bringing their properties up to code. It appears these regulations are nothing more than \"feel good\" rules for the general public, but in reality, they do nothing for the safety of residence and only prohibit an otherwise legal activity for HUD residence.

       " \"January 19, 2016   Regulations Divisions Office of General Counsel Department of Housing and Urban Development 451 7th Street SW, Room 10276 Washington, DC 20410  To Whom It May Concern:  The American Lung Association in Maine is pleased to submit the following comments (and attached background report from the Breathe Easy Coalition) in strong support regarding the proposed rule Docket No. FR 5597-P-02 Instituting Smoke-Free Public Housing.  The mission of the American Lung Association is to save lives by improving lung health and preventing lung disease: one of the best ways to achieve our mission is to limit exposure to secondhand smoke.  The United States Surgeon General has determined that there is no risk-free level of secondhand smoke which contains hundreds of chemicals known to be toxic or carcinogenic.  Secondhand smoke is especially harmful to young children.  Exposure to secondhand smoke is responsible for between 150,000 and 300,000 lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children under 18 months of age, resulting between 7,500 and 15,000 hospitalizations each year, and 430 sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) deaths in the United States annually.  In Maine, we have a strong and proud history of enacting laws and policies creating smoke-free spaces.  This month we celebrate the fourth anniversary of all Public Housing Authorities (PHA) in Maine adopting smoke-free policies.  The result of these voluntary policies is that over 4,300 units and 10,000 Maine residents have lessened their risk of the negative health effects by living in a smoke-free environment.  The Maine experience has shown that while not easy, the change toward adopting smoke-free policies is possible, welcomed by many and is ultimately successful.  The Breath Easy Coalition (BEC), and their Smoke-Free Housing Coalition of Maine program were the on the ground leaders who helped move Maine's PHAs toward adopting smoke-free policies.  Attached to our comments please find a brief document from BEC providing background on the Maine success story and experience implementing smoke-free policies.  The American Lung Association in Maine urges you to adopt the proposed rule and encourages the inclusion of e-cigarettes and hookah products in the final rule which would further protect public health and aid in implementation and enforcement.  Thank you for your consideration of these comments.  Sincerely,   Lance Boucher Director of Public Policy American Lung Association in Maine\",\n",

       " 'I am formally submitting a response to Docket # FR 5597-P-02, \"Instituting Smoke-Free Public Housing,\" which could potentially protect the lives of millions of vulnerable Americans. I have already signed on to other comments provided by NAATPN, Inc. and the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education of the University of California, San Francisco. However, I wanted to provide comments reflective of my personal experiences with a resident of a HUD facility, my mother.  My mother struggled with her nicotine addiction for the last 10 years of her life. Though she remained smoke-free during most of this time, her daily constant exposure to secondhand smoke made it difficult for her to be free of her nicotine cravings. The most challenging thing for her was having to walk pass people smoking and their smoke as she entered and exited her home. She lived in a HUD building in Richmond, CA. There were \"no-smoking\" signs around the outside of the facility and inside near the elevators. However, there was absolutely no enforcement of this policy whatsoever. As my mother lived at the end of the hallway where the stairs were located, her home had a constant flow of secondhand smoke from the the people who smoked in the nearby stairwell.  Many residents, like my mother, are too intimidated by their smoking residents and guests of those residents. My mother lived alone, which is the case for many residents, who rely solely on government assisted housing. So for many of them, especially elderly and disabled women, their sense of safety is already compromised.   While I commend your efforts to make HUD residences smoke-free, I ask that you also find a way to inspire your facilities to embrace a real dedication and commitment to enforcing the policy. Please.  P.S. My mother lost her battle to remain smoke-free. After almost 7 years of not picking up a cigarette, she eventually gave into the urge. She thought she could relieve her cravings if she had only one cigarette - just one. It led to her smoking the last 3 years of her life. She died from pulmonary and cardiac complications due to the smoking.',\n",

For 12 years I was a landlord with rental property here & also maintained that property for approximately 10 years prior to ownership. I am a 2 time cancer surviver. I experienced  adrenal cancer in 2001 and 2006. In both cases large abdominal tumors were surgically removed. Following complications in both cases including abdominal post surgical staff infections, secondary surgeries & several other complications, but it should be noted that the cancer I suffered was deemed unrelated to smoking. I also suffered a fractured spine in 2 places due to 2 non-fault auto accidents. I was a passenger in both cases, however was not awarded any substantial claim. As a result of my injuries I lost my home and property. I am now considered disabled and reside in HUD Housing.                    As former Landlord, I had to know what tenants expected;  a) clean/functional unit, fresh paint on walls & ceilings (currant policy at HUD)  b) right to privacy  c) mutual agreements to policy   d) property upkeep.                   There were restrictions in place that would limit my access to a rental unit. I had to schedule routine maintenance and enter only with my tenants consent. The only time I could legally access a unit with out my tenants consent was in the event of a life threatening emergency (like a fire for example). Residents had privacy rights. If we suspected criminal activity the law required we call police...even though by doing so we risk multiple lawsuits if a conviction is not the result. In the real world (private sector) the law most certainly favors the tenant.                   I would like to start out by saying I have no problem abiding by smoking policy as it is currently written (Clearly it was written by reasonable people...).That being said, in light of the proposed smoking ban policy I would like to submit that;               1) HUD\\'s Maintenence cost savings is false argument because;  a) Routine cost is about $250-450 to clean & paint an average unit.  b) it is already policy of HUD so it is a mute point, 2)My State already has oppressively high cigarette taxes imposed on citizens that purchase these LEGAL PRODUCTS, so the State currently benefits substantially from the sale & consumption of such LEGAL PRODUCTS. In light of this I would suggest that;  a) Implementation of such a policy would directly effect in a negative way funds currently being generated for the State by such taxation of LEGAL PRODUCTS and  b) HUD should petition a claim from those funds, derived from cigarette taxation, to cover additional claims of maintenance costs from the State, such as fire insurance.(Fire extinguishers could also be utilized in smoking units, as a preventative measure for example. I\\'m sure HUD is well aware of this)               Unfortunately life is messy & unforseen expenses do happen, It\\'s all part of doing business but certainly does not trump Constitutional Rights of the individual in their own private residence, nor is it necessary.               \"Passive\"(or second hand) smoke health claims have been greatly exaggerated to excite controversy & have even been debunked in several publications as fraudulent. Concerns regarding primary smokers health costs?...Frankly it\\'s nobody\\'s business. Again, life is messy & eventually everybody dies from something...Violating peoples right to privacy won\\'t change that! Bottom line, costs don\\'t trump Rights. If HUD is actually trying to save money, how much are they planning on spending to ENFORCE this new policy?                         BTW, what does $496.8M NATIONALLY average out in savings per unit?...not as much as you might think.(Our government wastes $496.8M every time a congressional toilet flushes!)                Most of these people do not live here by choice, They have no alternative! Those of us who are elderly or disabled are already under strain & suffering terribly. Many of us have undergone great personal tragedy & loss of Liberty to end up here...now subjects to the HUD inquisition!               ',\n",

The proposed federal rule announced in November, 2015 by the Department of Housing and Urban Development would affect approximately 1.2 million households nationwide.  The policy will disproportionally affect the mentally ill who live in Public Housing.  This policy will affect my son and people like him:  persons who are seriously mentally ill and who are addicted to tobacco products.  The proposed policy would prohibit smoking inside public housing units, indoor common areas and public housing administrative office buildings. Smoking would also be off-limits in all outdoor areas up to 25 feet from the housing and administrative office buildings. The proposed policy disproportionally affects persons who are mentally ill and those who may suffer from addiction.  The individuals who are diagnosed with a mental disorders and/or substance addiction disproportionally represent those persons who have tobacco addictions.   According to the Federal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, February 8, 2013, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR): \"Nationally, nearly 1 in 5 adults (or 45.7 million adults) have some form of mental illness, and 36% of these people smoke cigarettes. In comparison, 21% of adults without mental illness smoke cigarettes. (Mental illness is defined here as diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional conditions and does not include developmental and substance use disorders.)  There are other troubling statistics from the MMWR: \\t31% of all cigarettes are smoked by adults with mental illness. \\t40% of men and 34% of women with mental illness smoke. \\t48% of people with mental illness who live below the poverty level smoke, compared with 33% of those with mental illness who live above the poverty level\"  Currently HUD allows individual community Housing Authorities to determine what is best for their community.  It is our preference to leave this decision up to the local public housing agencies who determine locally if their community supports opting for smoke-free public housing.  It is recommended the current policy remain at the local level instead of implementing a federal policy banning smoking as detailed within the proposed ruling.

       " 'January 18, 2016  Secretary Julin Castro c/o Regulations Division, Office of General Counsel U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 451 7th Street SW, Room 10276 Washington, DC 20410-0500  Re: Instituting Smoke-Free Public Housing Docket No. FR 5597-P-02  Dear Secretary Castro:  A Smoke Free Paso del Norte (ASFPDN), an initiative funded by the Paso del Norte Health Foundation, is a comprehensive and coordinated approach to tobacco control in the Paso del del Norte region that helps oversee and support the Paso del Norte Tobacco Control Network (PdNTCN). For over 15 years ASFPDN grantees and Network partners have worked to reduce the prevalence of smoking to 14% and helped to initiate and support smoke-free environments in workplaces, public parks, bus stops and restaurants and bars for nearly 1,000,000 residents. The implementation of the smoke-free policy of the Housing Authority of the City of El Paso (HACEP) for its 17,000 residents and the coordinated and comprehensive effort the organization took in its approach are precisely those that should be carried out across the country.   We along with other partners, such as the City of El Paso Department of Public Health, support HACEP in their efforts to provide cessation classes, educate the community on the effort, and provide activities for residents. It is because of this knowledge and experience we feel it is in the best interest of all Public Housing Authority\\'s (PHAs) to encourage U.S. Housing and Urban Development leadership to institute a plan to mandate smoke-free properties for its residents.   Community based smoke and tobacco control organizations, such as A Smoke Free Paso del Norte, or statewide efforts can be called upon to help in numerous capacities and act as partners. According to the CDC Best Practices (2014) for comprehensive tobacco control \"Community engagement is essential for meaningful change to occur.\" Coordinated efforts can help to reduce costs, increase success through best practice knowledge, and allow residents options to obtaining help in their cessation efforts. National resources available online from the American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association as well as groups such as Americans for NonSmokers Rights and state tobacco programs are free services that can be used to help reduce costs.   Additionally, with regard to the question of burdens, costs and eviction targeting any specific population, ASFPDN and PDNTCN, do not believe this proposed rule threatens residents. Though we acknowledge the perception and possibility of these actions we note a smoke-free policy can be instituted with the intention of creating a culture of respect for tobacco users and non-tobacco users alike. IT is critical that PHAs have in place not only steps to assure that smokers are offered assistance through cessation programs but that communication with those residents who will be effected is done early and often. Quitting is not east ant the purpose of a smoke-free policy should not be punitive; instead it should provide individual smokers with the opportunity to respect her/himself and her/his fellow residents and adhere to the policy. Self-enforcement is also a tool that helps to instill resident\\'s feelings of empowerment and encourages pride in their communities.   When reviewing the City of El Paso\\'s ordinance on smoking in work and public places, ASFPDN worked to extend the city\\'s\\' ordinance to electronic nicotine delivery systems. The unknown dangers and lingering questions about these devices are not to be taken lightly. The health of residents and the potential, if unproven, dangers of ENDS should help leadership to follow in the footsteps of many communities across the country that have included these devices in their ordinances.   Lastly, as it stands this proposed rule does not apply to dwelling units in mixed-finance buildings, including Section 8 housing. ASFPDN and PDNTCN believe that HUD leadership must take action to protect not only those citizens that reside in PHAs but to all those citizens it supports. A fair and equitable law provides coverage for all residents and to exclude a significant population would prove unfair and unjust. Private property owners are required to meet minimum standards when applying to become a Section 8 or mixed-finance property. To include a smoke-free policy would provide the same benefit to private property owners as a HUD property would have under the proposed rule, to include a decrease in property insurance and reduced costs to renovate after a smoker leaves the property. Again, the rule should not be viewed as a burden but as an opportunity for enhancement.  Respectfully,   Members of the Paso del Norte Tobacco Control Network',\n",

Upon in depth and thorough review of the proposed regulation, as the City-Wide Resident Council for the GGHA, we feel that the policy is an infringement upon a person's rights to peaceful enjoyment in their own home and deciding to smoke and/or not to smoke. We strongly disagree and feel that Public Housing Residents are being singled out and that other federally funded programs are not being told they have to adopt a Non-Smoking Policy. We believe this is a form of discrimination in only requiring Public Housing Residents and not requiring all participants that live in any type of Federal Assisted Housing to adopt a Non-Smoking Policy. We also believe that this will result in additional vacancies for Public Housing because individuals that smoke have indicated that they will be moving if HUD makes the proposed rule a final rule as written.  Why this may be required for Public Housing residents and not for all other residents of federally subsidized housing regardless of where they get their federal funding? Also, if HUD does publish a final rule requiring Public Housing to adopt Non-Smoking Policy, we are requesting a written opinion that the rule is not discriminatory and why it is not discriminatory issued by the Office of Fair Housing.

       " \"In response to specific questions for comments:  1)  This PHA adopted its smoke-free policy effective 7/01/2007,  with one update effective 7/01/2014.  The only barriers encountered were from residents who had difficulty with visitors who smoke.  There were no costs to implementation, and the only cost to enforcing is the involvement of  staff time for notification, meetings, etc. 2)  The proposed rule addresses the adverse effects of smoking, including second-hand and third-hand smoking.   3)  The proposed rule does not create a burden or cost to specific families; but does provide benefits to non-smokers, and to the agency.  Non-smokers are attracted to the agency, which assists with marketing.  The agency has benefitted financially  from reduced renovation costs following move-outs, as well as trimmed unit turnaround time.  Residents who have been dissatisfied with the policy have chosen to move following a lease term.  There have been no evictions as a result of policy adoption and implementation. 4)  There have been no exceptions to the policy requirements.  No residents have requested exceptions. 5)  Initially, this agency allowed current smokers to be grandfathered-in, as long as they remained in their current unit.  The policy was revised in 2012, with a July 1, 2014 effective date to eliminate the clause that allowed grandfathering, requiring all residents to go off property to smoke. 6)  The agency offered smoking cessation courses, education with the local health care providers and local health department. 7)  The most useful area of support would be recognition from the department of HUD that granting a Reasonable Accommodation  for a disabled individual to smoke in a unit or on the property will result in broad non-compliance and abuse of the Reasonable Accommodation benefit.  Reasonable Accommodations to allow smoking in the units or on the property should not be allowed for disabled individuals, as smoking does not positively impact  or improve a 'major life activity' (i.e. eyesight, hearing, tasting, walking, breathing).  Conversely, smoking negatively impacts these major life activities.  However, many care providers are very free in writing Reasonable Accommodation excuses for families.  It is a very much abused provision. 8)  The policy should be expanded to include electronic nicotine delivery systems. 9)  The policy should be expanded to include waterpipe tobacco smoking.  Waterpipe tobacco smoking may or may not increase  the risk of fire or property damage, but allowing it would lead to non-compliance with the policy provisions and potentially  would lead to fair housing issues due to differing treatment of residents.  As stewards of public funds, we are responsible for administering our programs and protecting people and property in the most  efficient and effective manner.  Individuals who rely on public housing must recognize that it is a privilege to be able to be assisted  and to acknowledge that this personal habit drives up the cost of maintaining property and negatively impacts their own and others'  health, which end up costing more for the general public.  Those who wish to smoke, at a tremendous cost to themselves financially and from a health perspective, should understand that the general public does not wish to subsidize this habit, and for the privilege  of assistance, they must agree to abide by the rules.  The financial perspective is especially troubling with the extremely low-income families who choose to smoke.  Relying on subsidy for rent payments, and relying on Medicaid for healthcare, which are both publicly funded, is some of the irresponsibility agencies must answer for when the public inquires.  With the limited available affordable housing in this country, there are more applicants for housing than agencies have units available for.  Low-income smokers must  choose their priority in order to continue to receive public support. \",\n",
       " 'I strongly encourage HUD to fully implement a complete and comprehensive no smoking policy that includes all tobacco products, including those instruments that vaporize condensed tobacco-replacement products.   Exposure to carcinogens that are passively left in the environment by smokers creates an enhanced risk to non-smokers of the same cancer that smokers created for themselves with the activity. Non-smokers who move into, visit, or participate in activities in enclosed rooms and buildings are often unwillingly exposed themselves to the cancer-causing chemicals left behind by smokers and vapers.  As stated in a report by the Firefighter Cancel Support Network, \"following the lungs, the skin is the body\\'s second largest organ in area and it is highly absorptive. Some areas of skin are more permeable than others, specifically the face, the angle of the jaw, the neck and throat and the groin. Skin\\'s permeability increases with temperature and for every 5 increase in skin temperature, absorption increases 400%.\"(1)  Where the lungs and respiratory tract are the most impact by active smoking, a person\\'s skin is the most susceptible organ to involuntary smoking. Everywhere we walk, everywhere we visit, everywhere we sit, everywhere we job, everywhere we participate in activities; we have skin exposed. Anything we can do to decrease or eliminate the presence of known carcinogens to that exposure is of benefit not just to individuals but to our society as a whole. According to the nonpartisan Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, it is estimated that the direct medical costs of cancer in the United States, totaling all healthcare expenditures, is $88.7 billion(2). At any time and place that you can implement a policy that will decrease those healthcare costs to recipients of your services, it is cost efficient to implement that policy.  E-cigarettes are fueled by batteries identified as the cause of several fire inside people\\'s clothing and the cause of at least one vehicle accident(3), and are flavored by products containing at least one chemical known as diacetyl which is suspected of causing respiratory illness.(4)  Regarding the hazards of hookah smoking, I would remind you that no matter what the use or purpose of its use, the use of combustion always carries an inherent increased risk of fire.  The December 2010 Mount Carmel Forest Fire just south of Haifa, Israel, is a perfect example of the dangers of hookahs.  A youth admitted to police that he had caused the wildfire through the negligent disposal of charcoal remnants from a hookah.(5) That fire resulted in hundreds injured, 44 dead, and over 250 buildings destroyed. (6) This is in addition to the already-present hazards from hookahs of the same carcinogenic secondhand smoke that is emitted from cigarette smoking.  Regarding the question about the cost burden incurred upon residents who are evicted due to violation of the proposed rule, how is that perceived burden any different than violations of any other policy?  If enactment and enforcement of a policy is to be determined by the financial risk incurred by a resident who elects to create a hazardous environment, then perhaps all housing rules should be removed. When a person chooses to live within the confines of another who offers a service or function, that person chooses to live within the guidelines and parameters of their host. I do not see that any person should be protected to create a hazardous and cancer-causing environment for the simple reason that they feel it would be costly for them to be evicted.  I work as a captain for Houston Fire Department in Houston, Alaska. In 2011, our city enacted a No Smoking policy for all city facilities, buildings, equipment, and vehicles. At the time of implementation, there was a lot of comments from firefighters about the harshness of \"the city going cold turkey.\" As a result of the policy, however, Houston Fire Department went from 80% who smoked to less than 20% within two years. As of today, only 10% of firefighters smoke, and one is in the process of quitting. There was pushback initially, and that pushback included public comments about, \"how can you force a volunteer to do anything?\" and, \"but you can\\'t fire a volunteer.\" But the firefighters elected to cooperate and buy into the purpose of the restriction which was to keep with the \"City\\'s intent to provide a safe and healthful work environment(7),\" and as a result smoking decreased, health improved, and no firefighters quit or had to be disciplined per the policy.

SHA implemented smoke free housing across the agency, first within its Seattle Senior Housing Program in 2010, then agency wide in all SHA housing in 2012. Our comprehensive implementation process included notices to residents as well as supportive measures through various internal and external partnerships, peer support groups, and by providing tobacco cessation resources and information to all residents. Approximately 2/3 of the households we serve are elderly and or disabled.  In our 5+ years of implementing this policy, we have not taken adverse lease action on any tenants. While we have a few comments and suggestions below for HUD in developing the final rule, our primary concern is that HUD allow for maximum local discretion, particularly in light of declining public housing funding, and within the shared goals outlined in the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act (QHWRA). To that end, we recommend \"grandfathering\" in previously-adopted public housing authority (PHA) policies that meet the same goals.  For example, we request that HUD refrain from making \"suggestions\" within the final rule around the placement of designated smoking areas and allow agencies discretion to adopt additional restrictions such as against smoking non-tobacco products (e.g. marijuana) or \"vaping.\"   The proposed rule suggestions include that PHAs may want to provide ways in which a resident can smoke outside of their unit willingly, such as by providing a bench under a roof and under the shade to encourage compliance with the rule.   Although this is a suggestion, we believe that some residents may view the suggestions as requirements which could make future discussion of these issues more difficult should lease enforcement become necessary, or if the distance between the residence and the alternative suggested should be more than residents are willing and able to reach.  It would be appropriate to remove any reference to where smoking may occur on PHA property from the Final Rule, and allow housing authorities to make the determination as to where and if smoking will occur on the properties.   In the proposed rule, HUD suggests that accommodations may be provided to \"residents with mobility-impairment or mental disability.\"  In general, smoking is no less harmful to disabled residents who smoke, and second hand smoke from disabled residents is no less harmful to other residents, than smoke from residents who are not disabled.  Under both Fair Housing and ADA regulations, nicotine addiction is not considered a disability, and smoking tobacco is not a recognized treatment for nicotine addiction or any disability.  Residents with mobility impairments may, as an accommodation, need an accessible route to designated smoking areas, but disabled residents should not be allowed to smoke in their units or on PHA property simply because they are disabled.  Furthermore, the determination of disability, and the need for an accommodation arising from enforcement of a no-smoking policy should be handled through the normal accommodation process and procedures within the policies of the PHA.  If HUD will be issuing regulations or guidance concerning how accommodations are to be provided in this area, we ask that HUD recognize the policies which individual PHAs have already instituted regarding reasonable accommodation requests received, in order to reduce placing additional administrative burdens on agencies. Any guidance without this clarification would make it challenging when attempting to resolve such accommodation requests.   In addition to the above statements regarding disability and accommodations, SHA would like to point out that there is a high degree of difficulty involved when attempting to enforce no-smoking policies, with regards to lease enforcement and proving smoking violations by residents.  It is extremely difficult to carry out lease enforcement and false expectations are created when residents believe that they will live in a smoke free environment.  To that end, SHA recommends that a provision be added to the regulation which includes: (1) the regulation does not guarantee that all public housing will be smoke free; and (2) a PHA\\'s inability to create a smoke free environment shall not be a basis for any claim by a resident for damages against a PHA or relieve the resident from any lease obligation.

       " \"I am an Executive Director and this Agency has a Smoke-Free Policy. The restrictions in the policy is not to smoke inside any buildings or Agency vehicles. Smoking on porches is allowed due to varying weather or health conditions. The Rule's restriction of smoking 25 feet away from any building is too restrictive and not user-friendly. During bad weather or times of sickness, individuals cannot/will not leave their home to walk that distance.    Smoking away from government work buildings is one thing but people do not live in those buildings. When requiring housing participants to get dressed, leave their home, walk through the rain, snow, wind or cold to smoke, they will not do it. Enforcing this rule will be extremely difficult and will place more unnecessary work on lease compliance staff.    The Agency lost a few residents when implementing the Smoke-Free Policy but if the residents are required to go 25 feet from their home, many, many more residents will leave. This is unfair to the resident and to the Agency which will increase the number of turn-overs making more unnecessary work for occupancy and maintenance staff.    I would highly encourage the removal of the distance restriction of 25 feet and only restrict from the insides of any building. \",\n",
       " 'We support the Department\\'s goals of improving indoor air quality in public housing which benefits the health of residents.  Nevertheless it is important to be mindful of the realities housing authorities face related to the current budgetary environment, staff reductions and steady increases in administrative and regulatory requirements.  The proposed rule mandates very specific requirements which should instead be voluntary and encouraged by the Department.  The rule does not allow for sufficient flexibility for HA\\'s to tailor these policies to local conditions.  Roughly 500 agencies have implemented smoke-free policies successfully but were equipped with the ability to utilize local discretion in their implementation, compliance and enforcement.  This ruling eliminates that discretion entirely.    Barriers to implementation include opposing previous Congressional direction to the Department to expand streamlining, increasing flexibility and limiting/reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens.  Also considering this ruling is an unfunded mandate it should be a voluntary policy not a requirement.  A mandate is unreasonable particularly due to the current funding environment of approximately 84% proration of operating fund and capital funds at half the annual rate of accrual.  The Department should continue to encourage the establishment of smoke-free policies in ALL affordable rental housing programs funded by HUD, not just public housing.  Why does the rule only apply to public housing?  Time and again public housing is held to a higher standard than other affordable housing programs.  HUD consistently insists that PHA\\'s should operate more like multifamily housing.  Why then institute prohibitions of LEGAL substance solely in public housing units?  If smoke free housing is a good policy, then it should be proposed for all affordable rental housing programs.  Also it is absurd that the Department recently released a notice in which agencies were encouraged to house individuals with criminal backgrounds and to be cautious of evicting persons related to criminal behavior, while simultaneously issuing a proposed rule which will likely result in evictions, including elderly and disabled persons, due to use of tobacco, a legal substance.  This is concerning, as is the consideration that adults below the poverty level are nearly two times more likely to be smokers than those above it.  Then there is the burden of enforcement, financially and administratively to programs that have consistently received wholly inadequate funding.  HUD states that \"time spent by PHA staff on implementing and enforcing the smoke-free policy will be partially offset by the time that staff no longer have to spend mediating disputes among residents over smoking in secondhand smoke infiltration within living units.\"  How did the Department determine the amount of time HA\\'s spent mediating disputes between residents related to smoking issues?  Considering the current inadequate funding environment which has resulted in increased caseload sizes and reduced staffing for many agencies, it is doubtful that any agency spends a considerable amount of time today mediating smoke related disputes.  Further, if the Department anticipates the agency\\'s are more likely to rely on self-monitoring by residents as an enforcement tactic, the exact opposite could occur and would create or increase existing tensions between neighbors.  Mandatory smoke free public housing policies will also entail considerable costs to residents, most likely the most vulnerable populations, including the elderly, disabled and those struggling with mental illness and mobility impairments.  Rather than issue a smoke-free mandate, the Department should instead continue to provide tools and technical assistance to those agencies who wish to voluntarily implement smoke-free policies based on their needs and local discretion.

       " 'HUD proposes that smoke-free public housing would improve indoor air quality, benefit health of PHA residents and staff, reduce risk of catastrophic fires, and lower overall maintenance cost. I agree.  However, why target the public housing industry only? The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) administers control/guidance over many programs that provides housing and or rental assistance. Will this rule apply to private HCV landlords, multifamily, the regulated IRS Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) properties?  If so, when?  If HUD is successful, the final rule should cover all programs not just public housing.  It is estimated that public housing represents less than one percent of the housing supply. Of that percentage we must ask the following questions: 1.\\tHow many residents in public housing will leave because they consider smoking a right?  2.\\tHow many residents will be evicted because they will not follow a smoke free policy?  3.\\tHow many residents will comply with a smoke free policy?  Enforcing a smoke free policy will add additional burden, work, and expense to all Housing Authorities. I applaud all that are smoke free.  Please consider the following before proceeding with a final rule. \\tUndoubtedly, smoke-free policies would be very beneficial to all PH residents, public housing authorities and the public as a whole, both related to health and financial impacts.   \\tSmoke-free policies are also a very worthy goal and should be an objective encouraged by the Department and offered (not required) as a potential policy alternative to all HAs.   \\tHowever, the proposed rule entails considerable cost (as detailed thoroughly in the comments below) and is a wholly unfunded mandate.   \\tFurther, the proposed rule does not allow for sufficient flexibility for HAs to tailor these policies to local conditions.   \\tWhy does the rule only apply to public housing?  Time and time again, public housing is held to higher standards than other affordable housing programs.   o\\tHUD consistently insists that PH should operate more like multifamily housing.  Why then institute prohibitions of LEGAL substance solely in public housing units?   o\\tIf smoke-free housing is good policy, then it should be proposed for all affordable rental housing programs. \\tShould the final rule proceed as proposed, it will involve significant implementation, compliance and enforcement costs across all agencies.   o\\tAgencies will not receive additional federal subsidies to pay for these expenses.   o\\tOf the costs discussed, HUD expects (and PHADA agrees) that the expense of enforcement efforts may be the highest, but they do not fully quantify it in the proposed rule.   o\\tEnforcement could include administrative time spent educating residents, notifying residents who are out of compliance, termination efforts by an HA, grievance hearings, legal fees and court fees.   o\\tThe Department states that \"[a]n unavoidable cost...is dealing with repeat offenders.  Eviction costs could range as high as $2.2 million in [the] first few years.\"   \\tMandatory smoke-free PH policies will also entail considerable costs to residents, most likely the most vulnerable populations, including the elderly, disabled and those struggling with mental illness and mobility impairments.   \\tWhile the Department alleges that there will be significant costs savings due to reduced healthcare costs and other cost related to smoke and potentially fire damage, HUD does not take into consideration the potentially significant costs related to unit turnaround as tenants are evicted due to smoke violations, or if they decide to move rather than abide by the new mandate.   o\\tThe increases in vacancies related to evictions and moves directly results in significant increases in maintenance costs.   o\\tIt could also seriously impact occupancy rates (currently a key priority to the Department) in some areas.  This policy could therefore negatively impact HUD\\'s own priorities.  Finally the question is, how did this great nation get this point? How can the government remove individual rights of people in their homes? I understand the possible financial savings and the health benefits however, I understand that smoking is a choice that each individual makes. This is a very delicate topic and must be handled accordingly to the benefit of all involved.   Thank you for your time and consideration.     ',\n",
       " \"See attached file(s)  The Nevada Tobacco Prevention Coalition (NTPC) supports the proposed rule to require public housing authorities (PHA) to establish a policy prohibiting lit tobacco products inside all indoor areas of public housing and PHA administrative office buildings and in all outdoor areas within 25 feet of the housing and administrative office buildings.    Public health advocates in Nevada have been working with multi-unit housing owners and managers to adopt smoke-free housing policy. Furthermore, recent efforts have focused on including smoke-free housing in Nevada's Qualified Allocation Plan. The HUD proposed smoke-free public housing rule aligns with efforts already happening in Nevada and if passed, will help launch a new wave of smoke-free housing efforts.  In Nevada, nearly 69,000 individuals have cigarette-smoke related illnesses and about 3,500 deaths are attributable to smoking-related diseases each year. Of these deaths, approximately 400 are due to secondhand smoke and smoking related fires. The financial burden of smoking in the State has an annual economic impact of 3.57 billion dollars.    In Nevada, recent surveys conducted in Clark County and Washoe County found that the majority (about 78%) of public housing residents (Clark County) and multi-unit housing residents (Washoe County) surveyed prefer smoke-free housing.    Data from 2013 indicate about 17-21% of adults in Nevada smoke.  However, in the same year, 62% of adult smokers in the State reported an attempt to quit in the past year.  Smoke-free public housing not only will protect residents from secondhand smoke but it may also encourage individuals that smoke to quit.  The NTPC supports national smoke-free public housing policy for several key reasons: \\tSmoke-free housing policy decreases the property related costs for property owners and managers \\tSmoke-free housing policy decreases direct and indirect healthcare costs \\tSmoke-free housing policy decreases the adverse health effects of exposure to second-hand/third-hand smoke           among residents \\tSmoke-free housing policy reduces structural fire risk  The proposed smoke-free public housing rule provides HUD an opportunity to be a national leader by crafting policy that safeguards individuals living in public housing by creating healthier indoor/outdoor living areas.

       " 'According to the Proposed Rule document on regulations.gov in 2011, smoking caused 17,600 residential fires resulting in 490 civilian deaths, 1,370 injuries, and $516 million in direct property damage. In relation to these catastrophic fires my friend had resided in one of the HUD (Housing Urban Development) Buildings when he passed away due to a lit cigarette. All the tenants were able to get out except for him because he was at the top floor. If this policy was implemented sooner there is a possibility that he would still be here today. In the NFPA\\'s (National Fire Protection Association) \"The Smoking-Material Fire Problem\" report by John R. Hall, Jr., July 2013, most deaths in home smoking-material fires were caused by fires that started in bedrooms (40%) or living rooms, family rooms or dens (35%). Smoking out of the window is not a safe alternative either, because it allows the smoke to enter back inside the house. Smoking is the leading cause of home fires and the number one cause of fire deaths in the United States.  Smoking in multi unit homes poses immediate danger for many people residing in these homes especially, senior citizens who live in the buildings that are immobile due to a disability and seniors who have oxygen tanks which could ignite. 82 percent involved smoking materials as the heat source according to the \"Proposed Rule Document\". Every time there is a house fire families lose their homes and everything they have worked for. For this policy to go in effect I think a lot more lives and homes would be saved. I also think e-cigarettes should be a part of this policy, we have little information on the dangers or lack of harm associated with these products and should not expose residents to something that has the potential to harm them. So if this rule is established damage caused by smoking and residents and PHA\\'s (Property Housing Authorities) both gain from seeing a reduction in injuries, deaths and property damage caused by fires.

       " \"On behalf of Enterprise Community Partners (Enterprise), I appreciate the opportunity to provide comments on HUD's proposed rule to institute smoke-free public housing. Enterprise Community Partners is a leading provider of the development capital and expertise it takes to create decent, affordable homes and rebuild communities. Since 1982, Enterprise has raised and invested more than $18.6 billion in equity, grants and loans to help build or preserve nearly 340,000 affordable homes in strong neighborhoods.  Enterprise is also a leader in helping developers, investors, builders and policymakers make the transition to a green future for affordable housing, which we advance through our Enterprise Green Communities initiative. Our Green Communities Criteria, which we wrote in consultation with some of the nation's leading environmental, public health and green building experts, is the first set of building standards in the U.S. to address the unique needs of the affordable housing sector. In these criteria, we encourage smoke-free affordable housing through the adoption of no-smoking policies in all common and individual living areas, and within a 25-foot perimeter around the exterior of all residential projects.  We strongly support HUD in advancing a similar smoke-free policy in its public housing. Secondhand smoke is the third leading cause of preventable death in this country, and air filtration and ventilation systems do not eliminate the health hazards caused by secondhand smoke. Smoke from one unit may seep through cracks in the building, where it is then circulated by a shared ventilation system or otherwise enters the living space of another. In addition to the negative health effects, smoking significantly increases fire hazards and increases cleaning and maintenance costs. Many property owners who have implemented smoke-free policies have experienced significant financial gains related to reduced maintenance and insurance costs.    Though we are supportive of a portfolio-wide transition to smoke-free housing, we do want to caution that challenges exist when implementing such a policy in existing, occupied buildings, compared to newly constructed buildings. A flexible and phased approach to implementation of a smoke-free housing policy in existing developments, coupled with resident services to support smoking cessation, will help make this transition a successful one. However, we believe that once implemented, both the residents and the public housing agencies managing the properties stand to benefit tremendously.

       " 'The proposed rule directly opposes Congressional direction to the Department to expand streamlining, increase flexibility and limit/reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens.  Instituting smoke-free policies in public housing should continue as VOLUNTARY only and should not be mandated, particularly due to the fact that it is an unfunded mandate.  The Department should continue to encourage the establishment of smoke-free policies in ALL affordable rental housing programs funded by HUD.   Localities should continue to have full local discretion to institute such policies.  A mandate is unreasonable, particularly due to the current funding environment of approximately 84% pro-rations of the Operating Fund and Capital Funds at half the annual rate of accrual.',\n",
       " 'As a Tobacco Control and Prevention Lead Coordinator, I provide technical assistance and resources to property owners and managers to adopt Smoke-Free policy.  Based on this experience, I can attest Grandfather clauses to a Smoke-Free  policy are not successful since this makes it difficult to enforce. The desire to be sensitive to smokers can sometimes lead  housing providers to go down the path of grandfathering but it creates an enforcement nightmare.   Currently, I am working with a property manager of a multi-unit dwelling who is procrastinating the implementation of  smoke-free policy because he rather wait on the mandate of HUD Smoke-Free Housing rule.  This is counterproductive when  residents are forced to cope with smoke drifting into their units from neighbors.  Many can not afford to move and are subject to the effects of secondhand smoke exposure, which often leads to preventable illnesses including death.   Many others have been successful in implementing enforceable policies.  Smoke-free policy should be treated as any other policy.  Property owners and managers can maximize their profits if the can save money in maintenance and renovation costs associated with the smoking in units.  Government can save money in health care costs associated with smoking in units.   Everyone deserves a healthy, safe and cleaner place to live.  These all can be achieved with the successful implementation  and enforcement of a smoke-free policy.      ',\n",
       " 'I am the coordinator of Tobacco Free Lincoln County, a non-profit tobacco prevention coalition in North Platte, Nebraska, and understand the risks associated with secondhand smoke. The scattered duplexes operated by the local housing authority allow smoking in the units, as do many of the market rate apartment buildings. People in the lower income level are disproportionately affected by this, especially children. The more expensive market rate housing tends to have smoke-free policies, but the lower income people need this same protection. It appears likely, that if the public housing were all to have smoke-free policies, the rental housing that caters to lower income residents would be more likely to adopt such policies, too. Otherwise, they do not appear likely to do so within the next several years.  I encourage you to adopt the smoke-free housing regulations, as they are currently proposed.',\n",
       " 'Public Housing Smoke-Free Proposed Rule Comments  Comments from Niagara Falls Housing Authority:  HUD should continue to allow for voluntary versus mandatory implementation of smoke-free policies. Universal policies are not effective for every community.  This policy is costly to enforce; grievance process must be established. There is a lack of resources to ensure success in implementing this rule.     Public housing authorities are experiencing staff reductions as well as increased policies, rules and regulations.  The multitude of these new policies post great concern.  Weather plays a factor for elderly and mobility impaired residents to be forced to go outside of their homes.  Creates a very dangerous situations, especially in the polar north conditions.  The Niagara Falls Housing Authority has a very difficult time getting a city court judge to evict a resident on most lease violations including non-payment of rent, over the course of three (3) months.  I cannot imagine  a judge granting eviction due to the fact that a resident or a guest smoked in the apartment.  The Niagara Falls Housing Authority does not appreciate the fact that public housing authorities are being singled-out within the rental housing industry.

       " \"01/05/2016  As executive directors of public housing, we feel a deep desire to provide safe and affordable housing to all of our clients.  The proposed non-smoking rule is in our opinion a step in the right direction but a step too far.  The limitation proposing a ban within 25 feet of a unit is excessive.  Many housing authorities have already voluntarily implemented non-smoking policies following HUD's published guides.  Many other will adopt similar policies as they see the effectiveness of the policies implemented by their peers.  For HUD to propose this as a rule is excessive.  1.\\t Many housing authorities already have non-smoking policies. 2.\\tResidents should not be completely removed from their home to indulge in their chosen activities.  (Outside the unit is sufficient to prevent most of the issues the policy is designed to impact.) 3.\\tLegal issues could arise from denying residents a basic freedom to choose. 4.\\tThe proposed rule does not address implementation or enforcement of the rule.  (Unfunded mandate.) 5.\\tThe rule is an effort to make units safer and cleaner and residents healthier.  It will fail because telling residents they may not smoke within 25 feet of a facility is essentially telling them they cannot smoke.  The threat of lung cancer and death does not force them to stop.  Neither will HUD's rule. Please accept these points as constructive criticism of the proposed rule.  Most directors do not oppose a non-smoking policy.  A well implemented and easily enforced non-smoking policy could be very beneficial to the authorities and the residents.

My daughter is living in a PHA that has already banned smoking, which is a great stride on paper, but lack of cohesive effort and commitment have severely undermined the outcome. Because standards for implementation, supervision, and enforcement are so critical to a viable policy, I recommend the following measures be adopted:  HUD should include a review of how each PHA has implemented this policy in its annual or other regularinspection, including a survey of residents on how the smoke-free policy is working, their suggestions for improving it, and how responsive the PHA and staff have been. The evaluation process should give incentives for PHA\\'s to improve their record or maintain a high evaluation by HUD in their implementation of the policy.  HUD should encourage the creation of Designated Smoking Areas if surveys of residents show interest or demand for such an arrangement to encourage those who still smoke to do so outside the buildings. Every PHA should show active measures taken to accommodate smokers as well as encourage those who are willing to quit smoking.  However, HUD should not allow electronic cigarettes, as they could be confusing in identifying violations.  HUD should include evaluation of and recommendations for how the PHA documents violations, and how they manage situations where a resident may need accommodations to help them comply (such as supplying a resident with nicotine replacement therapy for a length of time while acclimating to the policy, if there are no other resources for this)',\n",
       " 'December 29, 2015  RULE NAME: Instituting Smoke-Free Public Housing DOCKET Number: FR 5597-P-02  Dear Mr. Secretary:  I am writing in support of the Department of Housing and Urban Development\\'s (HUD) proposal to make all public housing properties smoke-free. The proposed smoke-free rule will improve the health of the tenants as well as save money for the agency.  I have been in a position to listen to complaints by tenants who live in apartments that are not smoke-free. These tenants voice a lot of frustration and concerns about secondhand smoke (SHS). I believe that everyone deserves to be protected from SHS. I would recommend that your policy cover balconies and patio\\'s as smoke still filters into non-smokers homes and their balconies/patio areas.  In my experience in tobacco prevention, I have had smokers tell me that they plan to quit smoking because their apartment is going smoke-free. Smoke-free polices assist tobacco users to quit. At the very least it helps them cut down on their tobacco use.  I would also recommend that your policies also cover all playgrounds. I have personally been exposed to SHS and needed to leave playground areas because someone chose to smoke there. Also by eliminating smoking in playground areas, smoking will no longer be seen as \"normal\" by children and it will protect them from SHS.  It would also be important to include electronic cigarettes, hookah\\'s etc. in your policies. It will be easier to include these tobacco products now vs. adding them later. This is a lesson that has been hard learned by many tobacco prevention personnel as they have worked to implement smoke-free state laws.  Lastly, as a government agency, it is important to spend tax payer\\'s money responsibly and wisely.  Having public housing smoke-free will save significant money in turnover cost as well as decrease insurance costs.   Going smoke-free is a win-win for everyone.

FAM Allies works to: \\tImprove the quality of life for those affected with asthma in our community \\tFoster and strengthen partnerships among key asthma stakeholders in our community. \\tProvide asthma care education based on best practices. \\tLink those affected by asthma, their families, other caregivers, and healthcare professionals to resources and services.  FAM Allies considers smoke-free multi-unit housing to be a priority for reaching these goals and improving asthma management.  Smoking and second hand smoke trigger asthma exacerbations in all people with asthma.  This is of particular importance in multi-unit housing because non-smoking residents, including children, can be exposed to tobacco smoke that travels through ventilation systems and under doors from neighboring units and common areas.  Under current rules, smokers have the right to expose non-smokers and children to asthma exacerbating and cancer causing substances.  Furthermore, FAM Allies would support language in new smoke-free rules extending the policy to e-cigarettes.  E-cigarettes are not currently regulated; however they are known to release carcinogenic substances.  Similar to tobacco smoke, these substances can't be contained within certain areas of multi-unit buildings - they also permeate the whole building.  We strongly encourage the Department to enact and enforce full (i.e., traditional tobacco  including hookah, cigarettes, cigars, etc.  as well as electronic smoking products) no smoking policies in all of their housing authorities.

       " 'The Breathe Easy NC Coalition is pleased to provide comments in strong support of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) proposed rule to make all indoor public housing in the U.S. smoke-free, including a 25 foot barrier.  Individuals with chronic mental illness are dying 25 years prematurely than individuals who do not have a chronic mental health illness, and major causes of death are tobacco-related cancer, heart disease, and lung disease.  With a smoking prevalence 2 to 4 times greater than the general population and a greater likelihood of heavy smoking, an estimated 44% of cigarettes sold in the United States are sold to smokers with mental illness or substance use disorders.    Smoke-free policies protect residents from breathing secondhand smoke.  Secondhand smoke in multi-unit housing can easily travel through cracks, holes, doors, windows, and plumbing and ventilation systems and affects both smokers and nonsmokers. There is no risk free level of exposure to tobacco smoke.  Smoke-free policies also help tobacco users quit, and prevent young people from starting, as the policies help establish a healthy community norm.     The Breathe Easy NC Coalition proposes three recommendations to strengthen the rule.   These are as follows:  1)  The smoke-free provisions should  include electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and hookah pipes and devices.   2) The rule should apply to all multi-unit housing properties that accept funding from HUD (instead of just public housing).  Housing partners that have gone smoke-free in North Carolina report cost savings from turnover and cleaning costs, as well as benefits in terms of insurance costs.  (3) HUD should recommend that Public Housing officials work with the state tobacco prevention and control program and their state Quitline to make available free resources such as state Quitline information and other support services to assist residents and/or potential residents who may decide to quit smoking.

       " \"Our PHA is small in size and in scattered sites.  The proposal to designate smoking areas 25 feet from the apartments will be virtually impossible to do, given the layout of our properties.  Even if a smoke-free policy is implemented, it will be almost  impossible to enforce.  If individuals are going to smoke, they will continue to do so.  Implementing a smoke-free policy will not protect children and the elderly from the effects of smoke, as the parents will continue to smoke inside their cars. I totally  agree that children and the elderly do no need to be exposed to the harmful effects of cigarette smoke, although some of the smokers are the elderly and you'll never convince them to stop. I also believe that if granting reasonable accommodations  pertaining to smoking to elderly or disabled residents, it will open our authorities up to potential discrimination claims from other non-disabled and non--elderly residents.  How are you to monitor if the residents are smoking inside the apartments and only in the designated areas? They will continue to do so and violate the policy in place and how do you prove they are unless you see it in their hand.  If you try to evict a resident for a violation of a smoke-free policy, how will a judge rule on this violation? Will they uphold it and support the PHA on the eviction, or will they refuse and allow the resident to stay?  Then the PHA has gone through the expense of an eviction to no avail and then lose and have to allow the resident to remain in the apartment.  Once this happens, do you think any other resident would abide by the policy if they see a judge will not uphold the eviction? I don't believe they will.  If a resident is a smoker, do you charge an additional security deposit, placing yet another financial burden on that person in order to obtain housing?  Again, could this be considered discrimination between smoking and non- smoking residents?  If you charge an additional security deposit, do you go back to current residents and make them pay the additional deposit, or do you grandfather them in? If they don't pay (if required) do you evict for non-payment?  I can see many problems that this smoke-free policy will create for authorities and I feel there are many questions that have not been addressed.  It would be wonderful if everywhere was smoke-free but trying to implement a smoke-free policy in public housing will be the same as it is at restaurants that are smoke-free and in order to get inside you have to pass by the smokers and you get the effects from it.  The electronic cigarettes are no different from the regular cigarettes, they still give off smoke and could create the same health risks.  Many authorities may have a way of preventing the effects of the smoke from  reaching non-smokers in designated areas far enough away from apartments but layouts such as ours will not have areas 25 feet from apartments to be designated for smokers.\",\n",
       " '965.651.   Applicability.  The District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA) believes that a policy to go smoke free is a local issue and should  be handled as a local decision making point.  However, if HUD looks to consider a national policy, it should be  inclusive of all subsidized housing.   965.653 Smoke Free Public Housing  (a)  In general. DCHA agrees that lit tobacco products pose a threat to the safety of residents, especially children, as well as to the property  itself. The policy rationale of preventing fires, however, may as well be extended to hookahs and bongs, which require  burning to function. For this reason, DCHA would support explicitly banning hookahs and bongs as well from public housing.  E-cigarettes, although perhaps less dangerous to the premises, pose potential dangers for second-hand inhalation.  Moreover, e-cigarettes pose a problem for enforcement, allowing residents to potentially claim that they were smoking  e-cigarettes in their apartments when cited for a smoking infraction. Such confusion would make it more difficult to fairly  enforce the indoor smoking ban.  As DCHA has sites for which the agency does not own the outdoor area within 25 feet of the \"restricted area\", the agency  recommends adding the language \"if applicable\" at the end of the last sentence of  965.653 Smoke Free Public Housing  (a).   (b) Designated smoking areas. Consideration of outdoor designated smoking areas at sites that include discussion with residents adds additional time to  the thoughtful implementation of a smoke-free policy.  This is another reason for allowing housing authorities to determine  the timeline for implementing the policy once the rule is final.    965.655 Implementation  (a) Amendments.  The coordination necessary to thoughtfully amend a PHA plan that includes meetings with affected residents, especially if  done outside the annual plan process, gives rise to the need for public housing authorities to establish their own  timelines for implementation of a smoke-free policy.  (2) Tenant leases, according to the provisions of 24 CFR 966.4. The task of having every leaseholder sign a new lease addendum is a lengthy process.  For this reason, DCHA  recommends allowing public housing authorities to determine the timeline for implementation of a smoke-free  policy once the rule is final.   (b) Deadline. DCHA believes that 18 months from the effective date is too short a period of time for implementing smoke-free housing.  In order to implement the policy as a District of Columbia regulation, a District agency must go through its own rulemaking  process, including public notice and comment. Furthermore, the process of entering into an addendum lease with every  resident household of DC public housing (which contains roughly 8,000 units) will take considerable time and expense.  DCHA proposes that housing authorities be given the latitude to determine the timeframe necessary for implementation  of the new rule. ',\n",
       " 'I appreciate the sentiment behind this new rule.  The public health benefits are clear.  Furthermore, like any other landlord, I see no reason why HUD lacks the authority to institute this policy.  Unlike market-rate tenants, residents of public housing are compelled by economic necessity to live in their units.  Nevertheless, I see no reason why they should not be treated like tenants who are subject to the terms of their leases.  That said, there appears to be an issue of fairness here for existing tenants.  Existing tenants signed leases without a smoke-free provision in their units.  I think it is unfair to require existing tenants who renew their leases to abide by this regulation.  Before I come to the larger issue at play hereenforcementI would like to add that I acknowledge that the right of non-smoking tenants to a smoke-free environment, in theory.  Undoubtedly, the right of residents to enjoy a smoke-free environment is a social justice issue.  However, in practice I believe that the difficulty and risks of enforcing this policy creates serious social justice issues as well.  In sum, I believe that the impracticality of enforcing this policy creates social justice issues that are more serious than the issues it would address.  In this era of increasing tensions between police and a wide-variety of communities, enforcing further smoke-free provisions will undoubtedly create confrontations that will almost certainly escalate into arrests and uses of force.  Unfortunately, at this delicate juncture, I believe that the legitimate right of public housing residents to a smoke-free environment must be sacrificed to prevent the complications certain to arise from enforcing this policy.  It is unreasonable to ask local housing authority police and security guards to spend valuable community trust enforcing this issue.    Enforcing this policy will be impractical.  What could possibly be the \"sticks\" to be used here?  Will people be sent to jail? (no) Will people be issued fines? (maybe) Fines will clog the criminal justice system with people who have no way to pay.  Will people be evicted from public housing? (maybe) I understand that space in public housing is limited and that those spaces could easily be filled with deserving people who abide by the rules.  Nevertheless, I\\'m concerned about the complications and expense of evicting people from public housing.  People evicted would almost certainly become homeless, seriously undermining their own health and costing local governments large sums in emergency services.  I know a lot of thought has gone into this policy and I think maybe someday it will be more feasiblebut let\\'s hold off for now.  I should note for the record that I am not a resident of public housing or an advocate.  Sam Schreck Twitter: @SamSchreck ',\n",

This mandate, should include, but not limited to, all sources of combustible tobacco.  These sources would include medical marijuana, e-cigarettes, cigars, water pipes and traditional pipes; or any other device that emits toxins and carcinogens from the smoke.  All of the data validates secondhand smoke causes lung cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, respiratory infection, asthma, and SIDS [sudden infant death syndrome] and the residents must be provided education and technical assistance to understand the dangers of smoke:  first, second and third-hand smoking.    In order for the Rule or implementation of the mandate; if you will, we must have the residents at the table from the beginning to the end.  This must be achieved through resident engagement, education and technical assistance.  This would lead to a well-implemented and successful smoke-free housing policy.  Again, a comprehensive and sound approach will require engaging the Resident Advisory Boards, Tenant Association leaders, PHA staff, supply materials, monthly or quarterly meetings, and incentives.  Grants could be sought to assist in the costs of the above approach.  Further, we must partner with agencies [American Cancer Society, American Lung Association, smoking cessation, etc.] that have quality cessation programs and/or treatments.  These partners would serve to inform, educate and support the residents about health-related issues regarding smoking.   In closing, smoke-free policies in housing are the next steps which would extend the lives, lower maintenance/rehab costs, but more importantly, educate the residents of the benefits associated with a smoke-free environment is invaluable.  The costs would be minimal compared to the costs of not implementing the Proposed Rule.    The 500 PHAs that have implemented smoke-free policies must not be \"grandfathered\" because it would create confusion and difficult to enforce.  I would recommend that Department of Justice be available to those PHAs in municipalities that would have difficulty in enforcing the eviction in Housing Court, otherwise the Proposed Rule would be without \"teeth\" and, may be deemed as harassment since it would be unenforceable.  Also, I would recommend that we seek support from the media do provide public service announcements on public transportation, in the movies, schools, community based organizations, and social media.  The PSAs should be written differently for men and women; men respond to data and women respond to narratives.  Residents must be reminded, gently, that they are guests/renters, if you will and rules must be made to benefit the overall good of the community.    These steps would help shape HUD\\'s mission to improve indoor air quality in public housing, reduce the risk of fires and lower overall maintenance costs.  I am much interested in helping you with the heavy-lifting and serving on HUD\\'s task force for smoke-free housing should one be created.  Thank you for the opportunity to comment and your consideration of the recommendations.   Respectfully submitted,    L. Brown, President 334 East 92nd Street Tenant Association /lb',\n",
       " \"I am an Executive Director of a PHA that has implemented Smoke Free Housing at all of our locations, including multifamily housing properties that are managed by the PHA.  The concerns we have with the proposed rule are simply the enforcement of such policies and local support.  The cost of installing specific smoking areas is significant to a small PHA that (1) does not have a lot of open space and (2) the 25 feet rule would require the residents to impede on the public's right of way, specifically making residents smoke in the middle of the street.  We have a 20 feet requirement which requires some residents to smoke in the street, however we have allowed them to smoke on the sidewalk for safety concerns of our residents.  This requirement would force residents to be put in harms way if PHA's are required to implement the 25 feet rule.  Also, we have concerns of the eviction process and receiving support locally if we evict a tenant who has smoked in their apartment.  Since adopting the No Smoking Policy, we have not processed any evictions, however we have made agreements with tenants to avoid eviction.  The agreements have been with disabled individuals and elderly residents.  We encourage the Department to consider flexibility with the requirements for small PHA's and PHA's that are located in rural areas.  \",\n",
       " 'The proposed rule is an important first step to promoting health equity and improving overall public health. Smoke-free housing policies protect all residents equally from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. Because drifting smoke between units cannot be adequately contained, the only way to effectively protect residents is to completely eliminate smoking in all indoor areas. To ensure that residents have access to safe and healthy housing, HUD should not allow any exceptions to a 100% smoke-free policy covering all indoor areas. The smoke-free housing movement is part of a larger clean air movement. As residents experience more and more smoke-free public places and work environments, they demand and expect smoke-free environments at home, too. Not only have more than 600 PHAs already adopted smoke-free housing policies,14 but many other types of multi-unit housing properties are also voluntarily going smoke-free. Some communities in California even require by law that all or some multi-unit housing be smoke-free.15  The experience of thousands of smoke-free properties across the country means success stories and lessons learned are available to assist HUD with implementation and enforcement of smoke-free public housing. For example, the campaign in Portland, Oregon resulting in a 29% increase in the availability of both private and public smokefree rentals between 2006 and 2009 has been documented and includes helpful tips about the implementation process that HUD could adopt. 16  The experience of others also indicates that smoke-free housing is legal,17 good for business, and good for health.18',\n",
       " 'I am very happy to hear about this proposed rule.  I worked six years at our city-county health department with a grant that focused on educating the public about the effects of secondhand smoke especially on children in homes & vehicles,  and working with local landlords in adopting smoke-free housing policies.  It was a challenge to get landlords to see the  monetary value in adopting a policy - many felt that if they went smoke-free, they\\'d lose tenants and money.  Also, living in SE OH, we have one of the highest rates of smoking in the state, smoking is a cultural habit encouraged from one generation to the next.  However, I was able to work closely with our local Metropolitan Housing Authority in getting a smoke-free policy passed at one of their main multi unit housing sites.  It\\'s not a perfect policy and at times challenging to enforce but it has provided a healthier environment for those especially vulnerable to the effects of second and third hand smoke - infants, children, elderly, those with respiratory diseases, etc.    Many public housing tenants who smoke, when interviewed, will declare that they have a \"right\" to smoke in the privacy of their home, this is true if they owned their homes but untrue if they\\'re renting.  There is nothing in the US Constitution that states smoking is a \"right\".  I was disappointed though in reading that the rule would not cover e-cigarettes or hookah.  The side effects might not be as bad as lit tobacco products but they do have their share of harmful chemicals and unfortunately we are seeing more people and young adults switching to these products thinking they are safer.  I hopeful that all will work out in the end...',\n",
       " 'I am writing as a landlord and an individual that has worked in public health for 25 years.  It is a kind and loving policy to have a home be smoke-free for individuals and families.  I strongly support the HUD policy.  Please look to local communities successes when sharing strategies on how to implement the policy.',\n",
       " 'I truly believe that the implementation of the \"no smoking\" policy would be beneficial to both the residence and management authority. This policy would eliminate potential health risk, as stated in the guide lines, and significantly reduce the out of pocket expenses accured by the housing authority. Having a smoke-free environment ensures both a healthier living environment and a cleaner residential appearance. Also, with the amount of money it would save the property management this could offer opportunities for substantial upgrades of living quarters as well as additional help to maintain the properties.   ',\n",
       " \"The proposed rule states that allowing a resident to smoke in their unit or building common area is not an accommodation that can be granted under these regulations once effective.    However, Fair Housing regulations require that accommodations be provided unless  *the requested accommodation imposes an undue financial or administrative burden        (allowing a disabled person to smoke in their unit does not)  *or requires a fundamental alteration in the nature of the provider's operations         (allowing a disabled person to smoke in their unit does not).  This provision of the proposed rule serves to place PHAs in a position where there is no correct answer, and that can and will result in legal costs that are not funded under the proposed rule.  Our agencies (there are 5 under management) all have smoking/smoke-free policies.  Each one is different and tailored to the property, and each one allows residents the choice to live in an area that is smoke-free, or if they chose to smoke, a home where they can do so without the risk or fear of eviction.  Three of these agencies suffer vacancies due to their location and the lack of nearby medical care, job opportunities, and other amenities.  Requiring the PHAs to set policy that will discourage any part of the population from participating in the programs and finding decent, safe, and affordable housing seems to be contradictory to the mission of HUD and these PHAs.  \",\n",
       " \"I am opposed to the proposed rule to require all public housing units to go smoke-free.    This is a one size fits all federal  regulation wherein a local decision-making process is more appropriate.   For several years, I have been a member of the  Lincoln-Lancaster County Smoke-Free Housing Task Force.   We have had huge success in encouraging landlords to go  smoke-free with their properties.    Smoke-free housing must be developed in a way that allows for the individual qualities  and differences of properties and the interplay of landlord and tenants.   Smoke-free policies are difficult to monitor and  enforce and the success of smoking restrictions is largely dependent on voluntary compliance.   In order to achieve voluntary  compliance, landlords must engage residents and develop site-specific policies and requirements.   The plan must respect  the tenants and minimize the burden of smoking outside.    The proposed rule does not due this.   In Lincoln's public housing,  smoke-free has been implemented for many years.  But that policy doesn't line up with HUD's proposal.   Changing what has  been a successful policy to now meet HUD's rules will be a disaster leading to non-compliance.   Requiring elderly smokers to  go 25 feet outside a building is a safety concern because of weather, mobility issues, and the possible victimization in a crime .   It just doesn't make sense to take a successful local policy and force federal regulation on it.   In some of Lincoln's single  family scattered site housing, a tenant may well have to stand in a neighbor's yard or on the street to meet the 25 foot ban.  In my opinion, this is close to ridiculous---again, local decision-making can take into account local needs.  HUD should continue to encourage and assist with smoke-free policies but should not impose blanket federal regulations.  \",\n",
       " 'January 12, 2016  As Director of the largest municipal health department in Maine, I am writing in support of the Department of Housing and Urban Development\\'s (HUD) proposed rule that would require each public housing agency administering public housing to implement a smoke-free policy.  The evidence to support the dangers of secondhand smoke and the need to reduce exposure among our residents is expansive. However, much of it can be summarized in one particular quote from former US Surgeon General Richard Carmona: \"The debate is over. The science is clear: secondhand smoke is not a mere annoyance, but a serious health hazard.\"  Smoke-free policies are not discriminatory. In fact, at the heart of this public health strategy is not tobacco cessation, but reduction of involuntary exposure to this serious health hazard. Smoke-free housing policies are about the smoke, not the smoker, with the aim being to protect all residents from secondhand smoke, particularly those disproportionately impacted by the health effects, such as children and the elderly.  Maine, like many other states and cities around the nation, is evidence that such policies can be successfully implemented in this environment. All of Maine\\'s Public Housing Authorities have some level of smoke-free policy, with some having implemented policies almost a decade ago. While education, communication, and enforcement are all vital pieces of the puzzle, success is possible and the time has come for wider adoption of smoke-free housing policies nationwide.   With this proposed rule, HUD has taken an important step in reducing involuntary exposure to secondhand smoke among thousands of people in the country. The City of Portland Public Health Division supports HUD in this effort.   Sincerely,   Toho Soma, MPH Public Health Director City of Portland',\n",
       " 'I represent the tenants for a smoke-free environment here at Ockers Gardens, Oakdle,NY - Islip Housing Authority.  There are 100 units here, most of which are senior citizens.  I circulated a petition for a  smoke-free apartments which was given to the Director and Bd. of Commissioners.  Of the 100, 51 signed in favor. 16 favored but would not sign, 8 smokers,15 sympathetic to smokers, 10 unable to contact.   So, majority here are definitely in favor of smoke-free regulations.',\n",
       " 'I agree with enforcing a no-smoking policy in public housing units and inside the administration buildings.  However, I DISAGREE with the enforcement of it within 25 feet of any building.  Our buildings that house our units and offices are located 5-10 feet from a major farm to market road and city streets.  Making our residents go 25 feet from their unit to smoke would put them in danger.  We also have elderly residents that cannot walk that far without imposing a risk to their health due to cold or wet weather. I have a smoke-free policy at this housing authority and have not had any violations because my tenants comply with going directly outside their unit to smoke.  I have not had ANY complaints from any residents about those who smoke imposing a hazard to them. Please consider removing the 25 feet requirement from this proposed rule.  ',\n",
       " 'Details of non smoking policies should be left up to each housing authority.  We don\\'t need another one size fits all policy mandate.  Each Housing authority knows the layout of their properties best, regarding how many feet from the building, which entrances to use to access designated smoking areas, etc.  Housing Authorities do not have the staff to be the \"smoking police\".  Burden of proof needs to be on complaining party.  This will eliminate false reports, personality conflicts reporting, etc.',\n",
       " 'I write in support of HUD\\'s proposed rule to ban smoking in public housing. Our agency was the third housing authority in the  country  to go smoke-free in 2004 and we have not regretted making this decision. Our only mistake initially was to  grandfather existing smokers, a mistake we corrected several years ago.  The air quality of our buildings is much better and  the health of our residents has been enhanced by this policy. HUD should add electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) to the prohibition as it appears these create air quality problems similar to those produced by second hand smoke.HUD should also take great care in developing a position concerning \"reasonable accommodations\" related to smoking. There are no  circumstances in which it would be reasonable to allow smoking in contravention of smoke-free policies. In fact, were HUD to  allow any exceptions, it would open up all housing authorities to legitimate counterclaims by non-smokers whose health is placed  in jeopardy by being forced to breath second hand tobacco smoke. Ironically, it could place housing authorities  in the position of refereeing  between the disabled, and addicts who happen to be disabled. Smoking is not a disability, it is a  cruel and relentless addiction, which can create disability. HUD is to be commended for requiring very specific language  concerning smoke-free areas, as clarity equals enforceability. Vague language concerning where smoking is allowed would lead to endless disputes. In our experience, even though we adopted the \"25 foot rule\" this is the absolute minimum distance needed to limit such disputes. The vast majority of public housing residents will thank HUD wholeheartedly for this long  overdue action. ',\n",
       " 'I urge you not to adopt this policy.  One person is stupid enough to smoke in bed and now nobody is allowed to smoke in the privacy of their own apartment that they pay rent on.  I thought that HUD has equal opportunity housing.  This rule constitutes discrimination.  If this is adopted, there will be a lot of discrimination lawsuits.  Please do not adopt this policy.',\n",
       " 'The rule the Department of Housing and Urban Development is proposing is both legitimate and justified and I fully support implementing a \"smoke-free\" policy for all public housing agencies (PHA) that administer public housing. I do not think that requiring agencies within eighteen months of the date the rule is adopted to implement the smoke-free policy is overbearing or unreasonable. Public housing is meant to provide a safe and healthy environment for people and their families to stay at. Invoking a smoke-free zone within the units and common areas and twenty-five feet outside the building is well reasoned in promoting the health of everyone in that area. I do not think anyone living in public housing can claim a legitimate reason that such a policy infringes on their individual rights. The potential benefit of implementing a smoke-free zone substantially outweighs whatever burden a person may claim such a policy imposes on their being. Furthermore, the policy will also promote the health and well-being of the employees of PHA. Aside from health, the note about reducing the potential for fires is also a good enough reason in my opinion to issue such a rule for public housing. Safety is a genuine concern that should be taken into account and such a policy promoting smoke-free areas rightfully protects the safety of everyone. Therefore, I find no issue with implementing a smoke-free policy in public housing.  ',\n",
       " 'I applaud the proposed smoke-free housing regulations proposed by HUD.  As a Community Engagement Coordinator working for the NYS Bureau of Tobacco Control, I have talked and surveyed  hundreds of housing authority tenants who would be thrilled to live in smoke-free buildings. The majority of residents have no  where else to live and are concerned about their health as they are forced to breathe their neighbors second hand smoke.   I have worked with a housing authority who voluntarily went smoke-free a few years ago. They had a large number of smokers  but with planning and good communication the new policy has been a success. These recommendations are pushing housing  authorities who have been \" on the fence\" to go ahead and start preparing to go smoke-free.  This is the right thing to do and just as Clean Indoor Air Laws were met with some hesitation in the end no one can imagine it  any other way.  I can see in a few years looking back thinking how crazy it was to allow smoking in large public housing  properties.  Thank you for taking this on and for creating a healthier environment for those who need it the most!!!! ',\n",
       " 'Comments of Norfolk Redevelopment and Housing Authority (NRHA) on FR 5597-P-02 Instituting Smoke-Free Public Housing:   NRHA believes that alternatives exist that more appropriately balance the goals of creating healthier living environments with the added administrative burdens of enforcing a new policy and potential negative unintended consequences for residents, particularly the elderly and persons with disabilities.  Difficult to Enforce As stated in a November 15, 2015 Baltimore Sun editorial, \"public housing agencies are not exactly awash in staff ready to enforce such a rule, they are struggling enough to keep up with basic operations and maintenance, much less to seek out smoking scofflaws.\" The proposed rule briefly discusses enforcement issues but does not satisfactorily provide a strategy for identifying rule violations and does not address resident efforts to hide a rule violation. Presumably violations would be reported by other residents and maintenance staff. Resident reticence to report violations, as well as abuse through false reporting, decrease trust between residents, staff and management.  Eviction Disproportionately Punitive Smoking is legal in the U.S. Eviction from public housing to an otherwise qualified citizen is the most severe resident action an Authority can take, and is typically reserved for the most egregious offenses. Courts have not looked favorably on broad public housing bans that deny legal activity. Like any landlord HUD can write its smoking policy into the lease, but unlike other renters, public housing tenants often have little choice about where to live. A policy meant to protect health and safety of tenants should not be carried out in a way that achieves the opposite effect by forcing homelessness. Implementation Costs Are High and Underestimated The proposed rule does a brief cost benefit analysis, but admits a full accounting of costs is not possible. While HUD agrees to foot some nominal training costs, it leaves it to housing authorities to establish and carry out policies, procedures and enforcement methods. There is also no accounting for enforcement and collateral costs to the Authority.  This comes with the looming possibility that failure to comply may result in loss of HUD funding.  Rewards are Absent The proposed rule insufficiently rewards resident compliance for what is a difficult lifestyle change. Essentially the tenant is punished by denying housing if they don\\'t quit tobacco. Effective behavioral change happens when rewards are present and those are lacking in HUD\\'s approach.   More Effective Techniques The proposed rule fails to adequately address and consider other alternatives that NRHA strongly believes would be more effective in reducing resident smoking by: \\tProhibit smoking in shared/common areas such as property management offices \\tCreate smoking and non-smoking units \\tReward non-smoking via a rent discount or other financial reward \\tPromote an overall health initiative that includes smoking cessation and rewards for health lifestyles  Community Partnerships NRHA has partnered with Eastern Virginia Medical on smoking cessation initiatives in our communities: \\tAmerican Academy of Pediatrics Grant on Tobacco Cessation in NRHA Communities \\tProvide public housing residents with educational training and resources on tobacco reduction, which takes place in their communities allowing easier access to services and opportunity to receive peer support.  Conclusion Given the huge property challenges facing many housing authorities with an obsolete housing stock, funding shortfalls, maintenance, rodent and pest control and community security concerns,  the proposed rule seems to be inconsistent with these more pressing concerns. NRHA recommends the Department more thoroughly study the challenges posed by a blanket smoking ban and to consider alternatives. Discretion to adopt smoke-free policies should remain at the local level. We also encourage the evaluation of the experiences of those housing authorities that have pursued non-smoking initiatives and the development of a more flexible proposal that reflects its findings.   ',\n",
       " 'While we commend the intent of the proposed rule (better health for residents, particularly children, reduced maintenance costs, reduced fire risk, etc.), we do not feel that an across-the-board policy for all properties for all PHAs is in the public interest.  We feel that there are far too many additional costs that would be imposed on PHAs in preparing for and implementing such a policy; further, it would be arguably a further discriminatory imposition on residents of public housing (such as the current community service requirement) that is not imposed on residents of other HUD-assisted housing programs.  In lieu of proceeding with this unfunded mandate, we would recommend that HUD make available financial incentives to offset the implementation costs for those PHAs who feel that they are ready and willing to establish new smoke-free policies in their properties.

Please expand the proposal to include mixed finance projects as well.    As a health promotion specialist working in public health for over 10 years, I have worked with multi-unit housing complexes to implement smoke-free policies.  During this time I also provided tobacco cessation services to low income populations.  Implementing strong smoke-free housing policies benefits everyone involved!    In many states, smoke-free signage and technical assistance is available through public health districts and state departments of health at no cost to housing entities.

Don't grandfather existing smokers. One smoking resident can have a negative impact on an entire floor or building for years. 2. Treat marijuana and electronic smoking devices as tobacco. No one's choice should create a health  problem for another or complicate enforcement. 3. Smoke free zone around protected areas should be a minimum of 20 feet, more is much better.  4.  Implementation of any new policy is sloppy at first . Housing management already has lease enforcement procedures and no smoking in a unit, common areas, on the grounds, etc. is just an additional lease requirement.  5.Over a 10 year time period the California counties of Sonoma. Marin, San Mateo and Alameda with legislated  SF MUH have few reported evictions over a tenant violating that part of their lease. 6. There is not legal requirement to make it easy for residents to smoke. 7.  SF MUH laws reduce fire risks.  There are many more reasons to support smoke-free multi-unit housing.

       " 'Secretary Julin Castro c/o Regulations Division, Office of General Counsel U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 451 7th Street SW, Room 10276 Washington, DC 20410-0500  Re: Instituting Smoke-Free Public Housing Docket No. FR 5597-P-02  Dear Secretary Castro:  In January 2015, the Housing Authority of the City of El Paso (HACEP) instituted a smoke-free multi-unit housing policy benefiting residents living in 48 public housing communities. As a result, close to 17,000 low-income El Pasoans now live in an environment that is free of second-hand smoke exposure. Like other PHAs across the country, HACEP benefited from the HUD document \"Change is in the Air: An Action Guide for Establishing Smoke-Free Public Housing and Multifamily Properties\".   Based on the experience of other smoke free PHAs, HACEP partnered with The University of Texas at El Paso College of Nursing and A Smoke Free Paso del Norte a regional initiative of the Paso del Norte Health Foundation, that supports a comprehensive and coordinated approach to tobacco control, to assess resident exposure to secondhand smoke and support for a smoke-free policy. Organizers followed the steps outlined in \"Change is in the Air\", and used the survey as an opportunity to engage with and educate residents about the potential policy change. Consistent with national data, local data suggested residents of public housing had higher rates of smoking and less access to cessation resources; of the 1422 residents surveyed, half said they could smell secondhand smoke in their unit, 87% worried about the health effects of secondhand smoke, and 80% supported a smoke free policy.   Training for property managers was a key component of policy development, implementation, and now enforcement. Though HACEP personnel have shared that there are substantial resources to assist with the steps up through implementation, there are limited resources that address enforcement. We suggest it may be useful to institute \"training teams\" or request technical assistance from PHAs who have had policies in place over a period of time and could speak to challenges in enforcement and evaluation aspects. Our partnerships with community members were extremely important for conducting community outreach and surveying residents, for identifying cessation resources that would be free and easily accessible to HACEP residents, and for providing resources and referrals to a wide range of cessation options including quitlines, healthcare providers (especially Federally Qualified Health Centers), local health departments, and other programs offering cessation services.   With support from the Paso del Norte Health Foundation and facilitated by the City of El Paso Department of Public Health, HACEP offers on-demand cessation programs in the communities where people live. One of the themes heard consistently from residents and public health advocates is that \"just because someone lives in subsidized housing, shouldn\\'t mean they have to wake up and breathe secondhand smoke everyday\". As a community with a strong clean air ordinance that bans smoking in all parks and other city-owned property, we strongly recommend making entire properties smoke-free, so residents are protected from secondhand smoke exposure.   The American Heart Association, World Health Organization, American Thoracic Society, the American Public Health Association, and American Academy of Pediatrics have all issued policy statements advocating for the inclusion of e-cigarettes in the definition of smoking and/or the banning of e-cigarettes in public places based on existing evidence of potential secondhand effects. Though it may be difficult for a PHA to make the case that e-cigarettes should be included in a policy, PHAs can take similar action as local governments and include e-cigarettes as part of strong clean air ordinances, and encourage HUD to track and share research on e-cigarettes. The data gathered could be shared across PHAs on the benefits or costs of including e-cigarettes in smoke-free policies and to encourage PHAs to share evaluation and enforcement strategies.  Finally, from both economic and health equity perspectives, and from HACEP experience, we strongly believe that smoke-free policies should be extended beyond PHAs and traditional public housing programs. Section 8 and Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) properties are not covered under HACEP\\'s existing policy or by HUD smoke-free policy compliance rules. Families living in these alternative subsidized housing programs are affected by similar health, educational, and economic disparities as those living in public housing, but existing smoke-free policy efforts have not reached this population. A review of rental market literature suggests that demand will grow rapidly at local and national levels for LIHTC and Section 8 programs. We encourage a smoke-free policy provision for LIHTC and Section 8 housing.  Respectfully,   A Smoke Free Paso del Norte',\n",
       " 'I\\'m fully in favor of HUD\\'s proposal to prohibit smoking inside all federally funded public housing units and at least 25ft from entrances. The negative effects of second-hand smoke to non-smokers have been almost universally accepted by the medical and scientific community for many year\\'s. Furthermore, the cost to public housing authorities to clean up apartments where a smoker lived is between $1,500-4,500.00 as opposed to less than $1,000 for a non-smoking resident. Furthermore, smoking causes over 100,000 fires each year, resulting in more than 500 deaths and close to half a billion dollars in direct property damage; additionally, smoking is the lead cause of fire related deaths in multifamily buildings. Many PHAs that have voluntarily adopted smoke-free policies reported that they started the process after such a catastrophic fire. It is estimated that through the proposed smoke-free rule, PHAs will save an average of between $16 million to $38 million per year in property damage. In summary, \"no-smoking\" policies protect all residents from second-hand smoke inside shared ventilations, helps maintain cleaner apartments, reduces the potential for cigarette-related fires and keeps everyone at a safer distance from cancer-causing agents in combustible cigarettes. Those who oppose this proposal on the grounds that many of our physically disabled and mentally handicapped residents would be at a disadvantage are not looking at it from the viewpoint of protecting their health but from a tenuous understanding of constitional rights. Smoking cigarettes is not a constitutional right afforded by our federal government. Interestingly, it\\'s been known that tenants in multi-unit housing such as PHA\\'s often quit smoking once a policy is adopted; further helping them live healthier lives. I believe it\\'s simply a wise decision to have all federally funded public housing authorities adopt a no-smoking rule. ',\n",
       " ' I am writing in strong support of the proposed HUD Smoke-Free Policy.    There are many reasons I believe this to be essential policy for residents of Public Housing, and I commend your organization for making this stride in the face of a lot of blowback from others against the policy. This proposal is also extremely important in light of the fact that there are negligent practices on properties that already have gone smoke-free.    My desire to see this policy come to fruition stems from an ongoing and very painful personal struggle.  My sister became disabled in her early 20s, and for over 25 years she has had to give up every aspect of the life she hoped fora partner, a family, and a career.    Instead, my sister has been living alone with debilitating pain, and spends her time either in doctor\\'s offices or trying to recuperate in her apartment, the one place she thought she could call her home.  But in the last few years, her home has also been taken away from her, as the residents in her building emit toxic fumes from cigarettes and other chemicals that sicken her at all hours of the day and night.    It is simply a miracle that my sister, who is my dearest friend, is still alive.    Despite her disability and the trauma of her circumstances, my sister fought almost single-handedly to help Hawaii pass legislation to make Public Housing smoke-free.   However, this success was short-lived, as my sister continues to suffer from secondhand smoke due to negligence of her PHA to maintain oversight.  I urge you to implement this policy, not just for the sake of my sister, but for all Public Housing residents, many of whom are children, pregnant women, elderly or disabled with no ability to choose where they live or to escape secondhand smoke.   Based on my sister\\'s experience and extensive research, I strongly encourage you to consider incorporating the points enumerated below, which I believe are an important part of the success of a nationwide smoking ban and will also help to close the loopholes that are causing negligence on properties (such as my sister\\'s) that are already smoke-free:  1.  Mandate the 25-foot distance from buildings, or as far as the property will allow.  If this is a very small distance, the PHA must provide Designated Smoking Areas (see #2 below).  2.  Provide support through incentives and/or HUD funding for Designated Smoking Areas, which would be a helpful tool for compliance, especially in states where weather can be problematic.  3.   E-cigarettes and water pipe tobacco (hookahs) should be included in the ban, because they emit hazardous chemicals and would water down the spirit of the policy.  4.  HUD should keep reviewing each PHA for compliance and adherence to \"best practices\" as part of the periodic inspection and review of PHAs, so that there is a level of accountability on a continuing basis for keeping the smoke-free policy viable at all levels of every PHA administration.  No PHA bureaucracy that is worried about more work should put that concern ahead of protection of the residents it has stewardship over.  It is crucial that HUD maintain oversight even after the rule is officially declared by HUD.  For the sake of my sister and everyone who lives in Public Housing, I am deeply grateful for your attention to this important matter and for taking the time read my comments.              ',\n",
       " 'Our Housing Authority has been Smoke-Free since March of 2013.   Our units are designed with private entrances and our Smoke-Free Lease Addendum requires our residents to simply step outside their unit.  Should we require that they move out 25 ft. from any public housing building, we would find it necessary to provide some type of \"smoker\\'s shack\" for inclement weather.  This would be an expense that is not necessary under our current Smoke-Free Addendum and which is not funded.  On behalf of our residents we are respectfully requesting that HUD consider allowing Housing Authorities to implement smoke-free policies based on their need, local discretion and continue to use any current or proven Smoke-Free policies.',\n",

Nearly two years ago, SDHC implemented its own Smoke-Free Policy on February 1, 2014. SDHC\\'s Smoke-Free Policy prohibits smoking anywhere at the more than 2,000 affordable housing units owned by SDHC and the 154 Federal public housing units operated by SDHC.  SDHC\\'s Smoke-Free Policy prohibits smoking lighted pipes, cigars or cigarettes of any kind, including electronic cigarettes and cigarettes made from any weed or plant.  Residents, their guests, and SDHC employees or contractors working on-site are not permitted to smoke in: \\tIndividual residents\\' apartments \\tEntryways \\tPorches \\tBalconies and patios \\tInterior common areas, such as community rooms, lobbies, hallways, and elevators \\tWithin 25 feet of the buildings  Prior to implementation, SDHC surveyed tenants, and 65 percent of those who responded preferred a smoke-free building. In addition SDHC gathered information from other public housing authorities that had already implemented a successful Smoke-Free Policy.   SDHC also partnered with the American Lung Association to inform SDHC tenants where they could seek more educational information about the health-related issues regarding smoking.  SDHC moved forward with its Smoke-Free Policy after a 2012 California law that authorized landlords to prohibit smoking at their rental properties.  In addition, SDHC\\'s Smoke-Free Policy also achieved a HUD objective.   HUD issued a notice on July 17, 2009, that strongly encouraged public housing authorities to implement nonsmoking policies because \"environmental tobacco smoke can migrate between units in multifamily housing, causing respiratory illness, heart disease, cancer, and other adverse health effects for those living in neighboring residences.\"  I commend HUD for its commitment to creating smoke-free public housing.  Sincerely,  Richard C. Gentry President & CEO San Diego Housing Commission ',\n",
       " 'While implementing a smoke-free (SF) policy does not require significant resources, there are costs associated with staff time to administer resident surveys and host resident and staff meetings. Often, local tobacco control or other health partners can assist with all of these tasks, thereby substantially decreasing the staff hours needed.  Another cost to consider is signage to reinforce the policy.  Depending on the size, material and quantity, signage can become a moderate investment.   In NYS, tobacco control partners have supplied some or all of the signs needed to housing authorities free of charge.  Because of limited funding, this may not be an option in the future or in other states.  Additional flyers to educate residents and banners/posters to announce the policy are other possible costs.   An often expressed concern among public housing directors and board members is the issue of enforcement.  Some believe that enforcement of a SF is near impossible because they do not have the staff hours to \"police\" the policy.  Instead of \"policing\", staff are expected to follow up on reported violations as they would any other lease violation. One property manager of a local housing authority dreaded enforcing the policy, but after several months, she said \"Our no-smoking policy is the best thing that ever happened to us.  What I feared would lead to confrontation has actually opened up dialogue and brought the residents together.\"  She has consistently followed up on complaints through written and face-to-face communications.  It does take some additional staff time, but the time and effort will pay off in property maintenance cost savings.  While this proposed rule goes a long way in protecting residents of traditional public housing from the effects of SHS, it can go further to protect those living in Section 8 or mixed-financed properties.  HUD already sets a Minimum Property Standards Criteria for developers of mixed-financed properties and could add smoke-free rules to the list of requirements for new projects.  HUD could also assign extra points to developers who propose to create smoke-free buildings.  This has been done in several states through incentives for smoke-free policies in their Qualified Allocation Plans, resulting in marked increases in SF affordable housing.    This proposed rule will benefit the health of public housing residents and staff - both nonsmokers and smokers.  In a 2015 survey of Schenectady MHA residents, 61% of respondents said that someone living in their apartment has a medical condition made worse by exposure to SHS.   A SF policy can have a significant effect on these residents and, in fact, research shows that it does.   In a survey of more than 30 affordable housing buildings in Colorado, respondents reported that nearly all health problems associated with exposure to SHS declined after implementation of a no-smoking policy (Impact of Smoke-Free Housing Policies:  Insights and Advice for Housing Providers and Managers. 2015).  And the positive impact is not reserved for non-smokers alone.  About 70% of smokers want to quit but a smoke-filled environment makes quitting difficult.  One staff member at the Albany Housing Authority recently told me that he has been trying to quit for years but being around tobacco smoke at work has made it near impossible.  He is hopeful that the new SF policy will help him succeed.  Again, the Colorado study and the survey in Schenectady showed that many residents who smoked either quit smoking or reduced their smoking because of the SF policy.    The potential burden on residents who choose to continue smoking is real but minimal compared to the burden on those with asthma and other respiratory conditions who cannot escape secondhand smoke in their home.   It will be more challenging to smoke outside in cold weather, or to get outside for those who are mobility impaired but there are other options.   Nicotine replacement therapies are widely available and at no or low cost. Some PHAs have also created simple covered areas away from buildings for those who choose to smoke.  HUD should provide resources and support for educating residents and well as staff.  While some housing authorities have had the support of health partners to create educational materials and to conduct staff training, not all PHAs will have those resources at their disposal.  Some helpful materials from HUD would be:  1.\\tFAQ document for staff and residents 2.\\tTraining document for staff 3.\\t\"reminder cards\"  to distribute to violators of policy 4.\\tMock flyers for resident meetings and testimonials  The proposed rule should include ENDS because there is growing scientific evidence that the aerosol emissions from ENDS could pose health risks.  Studies have shown that when highly heated, emissions can contain formaldehyde, a known carcinogen.  E-cigarettes have also been known to explode, causing fires and harming users.',\n",
       " 'I worked for seven years in tobacco control for New York State and have personally talked with and witness the ill of effects of smoking in public housing.  In 2009 I conducted a door-to-door survey with of residents in Oneonta, NY\\'s Housing Authority, Nader Towers, to determine if they wanted their building to be smoke-free.  At that time many of residents invited me into their apartments so I could smell the smoke drifting into their units from neighbors.  Many of them felt trapped because they could not afford to move.  In 2010 as a result of the resident survey, Nader Towers banned smoking but grandfathered in existing smokers.  The grandfathering caused more problems.  In the last month, November 2015, I had a resident call me to ask for assistance to get rid of the smoking.  He had recently developed asthma as a result of being exposed to second-hand smoke.  Even residents who are not grandfathered in are smoking and executive director, Kurt Schulte said, \"There are some people that we suspect cheat and don\\'t follow the policy\" to The Daily Star, Wednesday, Dec. 2, 2015.  In the same article Mr. Schulte also said \"But Kurt Schulte, executive director of the Oneonta Housing Authority, which owns the facility, said his hands are tied since the federal Housing and Urban Development agency has no mandate prohibiting smoking in its buildings.\"  Nader Towers would have been successful if they would have implemented a smoke-free policy which didn\\'t allow anyone to smoke.  Executive directors like Schulte are relying on the Department of Housing and Urban Development to make the mandate.  Every should have the right to live in a healthy environment.  Please institute a smoke-free policy nationwide.',\n",

Instituting Smoke -Free Public Housing    Re: Comments on instituting smoke -free public housing proposed rule   To Whom It May Concern:    The National Housing Conference  (NHC)  appreciates the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule  to institute smoke -free policies in public housing.  We welcome HUD™s action to make public housing  safer and healthier for residents  while reducing property damage and operating costs.  We offer several  comments here in hopes of making the proposed rule more flexible and effective , especially for  public  housing authorities ( PHAs ) who have not undertaken smoke -free policies already and may encounter  unexpected challenges .   Our recommendations for improving the rul e, with additional detail below, in summary are that HUD  should:   1. Give PHAs guidance on how to effectively engage reside nts to identify needs and promote   acceptance of the policy.   2. Help PHAs build partnerships to provide smoking cessation resources.   3. Clarify how the rule applies to marijuana.   4. Give PHA™s flexibility on e -cigarettes and hookahs.   5. Define and allow accommodati ons to the rule, especially for persons with disabilities and the  elderly.    I. About the National Housing Conference   The National Housing Conference represents a diverse membership of housing stakeholders including   tenant advocates,  mortgage bankers, nonpro fit and for -profit home builders, property managers, policy  practitioners, real estate  professionals, equity investors, and more, all of whom share a commitment to  safe, decent and affordable housing for  all in America. We are the nation™s oldest housing a dvocacy  organization, dedicated to the affordable housing mission  since our founding in 1931. We are a  nonpartisan, 501(c)3 nonprofit that brings together our broad -based membership  to advocate on  housing issues.  II. Benefits of  smoke -free housing    The proposed smoke -free rule  would  make a successful voluntary program mandatory  for all public  housing . If successful, eliminating smoking would bring many benefits, which the proposed rule  documents thoroughly :   Protection and sustainability of  the federal investment in  public  housing .  The  federal  government  has made  substantial investments  in  public  housing  properties over many years , an  investment worth maintain ing . Eliminating smoking would address a major source of accidental  property damag e.   Furthermore,  public housing agencies (PHAs)  would benefit from reduced  turnover costs , freeing scarce resources to sustain the housing and serve residents .   Improve d hea lth and safety of the community.  Research has clearly demonstrated the harmful  effe cts of second hand smoke , which this proposed rule addresses directly.  Low income people  disproportionally develop smoking related illnesses and this proposed rule would help to narrow  the health divide.    Decreased risk of fire and saving s incurred  from reduced insurance premiums.  The rule  anticipates that  PHA s will benefit from reduced insurance premiums from the decreased risk of   smoking -related  fires. The savings incurred can be used to support smoking cessation  partnerships and to fund other cri tical services.   Promotion of  healthy life styles  for residents.  There are significant health disparities and smoking  rates based on one™s income level.  This rule  is a significant first step in reducing health  risks  among low -income individuals. NHC applaud s HUD for taking a non -paternalis tic  approach to  smoking cessation in their resource manual. HUD should continue to make clear that they are  not asking residents to quit smoking,  but  rather asking residents to not smoke on the property.  Should residents ch oose to quit, adequate cessation resources  should be available .  III. Comments on the proposed rule   The overall approach in the proposed rule is sound.  HUD defines the objective of smoke -free public  housing clearly, sets appropriate deadlines for PHAs to achi eve the objective, and builds on the  experience of many PHAs that have already voluntarily undertaken smoke -free policies.  However,  because the past experience is all from voluntary action by PHAs, new challenges may arise when all  PHAs are required to ma ke their properties smoke -free.  The initial voluntary approach likely attracted  those agencies for whom the policy change was most in demand by residents and easiest to implement.  As all PHAs undertake smoke -free policies, HUD should be prepared to allow  them flexibility to  accommodate the needs of residents and unexpected challenges of implementation.   With the need for flexibility as an underlying theme, we offer several specific comments.     1. Give PHAs  guidance on  how to effectively engage residents to  identify needs and promote  acceptance of the policy.  PHAs and private property owners who have made their properties  smoke free observe that  resident engagement is critical to success.  Resident engagement  should come in the form of surveys, public meetings ,  feedback options  and  one -on -one  interactions with property staff . The cost burden of this activity is real, and HUD should allow  PHAs maximum budgetary flexibility to meet this up -front cost, since the savings from smoke -free policies only come later.    2. Help PHAs  build partnerships  to  provid e smoking cessation resources.  Partnerships to provide  education on the harmful effects of second hand smoke and to provide smoking cessation   resources  appear frequently in accounts of  successful implem entation of smok e-free policy.  Community partners can  act as a n unbiased  voice to  educate community members on the  harmful effects of second hand smoke and the benefits of smoking cessation.  Partners may also  bring their own resources for providing smoking cessation  resources, mitigating the cost impact  for the PHA.  HUD should identify national organizations that can refer local partners and  suggest other means for connecting locally.    3. Clarify  how  the rule applies to marijuana.  Several states and the District of Col umbia have  legalized  or decriminalized  marijuana  use . As proposed,  the rule only applies to lit tobacco  products , not marijuana.  However,  marijuana  pose s similar smoke and fire safety concerns.  We  recognize  the complications of conflicts between federal a nd state drug laws, and we  understand that HUD has limited ability to resolve those issues.  To the extent possible, HUD   should provide PHAs with practical guidance on how to implement smoke -free policies in  jurisdictions that allow legal marijuana use, bu ilding on the experience of PHAs in those areas  that have already gone smoke -free.   4. Give PHA™s flexibility on  e-cigarettes and hookahs.  Research on the harmful effects of  e-cigarettes is rapidly evolving .  Some  view e -cigarettes as a harm reduction and smoking  cessation tool.  PHA s need to be sensitive to the cultural significance of hookahs  and the need of  some residents to find smoking alternatives . We  therefore  urge HUD to give PHAs the authority  to deci de how  to address these options  in ways appropriate to their specific circumstances .   5. Define and allow  accommodations to the rule, especially for persons with disabilities and the  elderly.  In examples of early smoke -free adoption, many PHAs and private property  owners  note that residents who wish to smoke can choose to move.  However, for some, public housing  is the housing of last resort.  People who are unable or unwilling to quit smoking may not have  safe, decent, and affordable housing alternatives, so  PHAs  wh o need to make reasonable  accommodations to the rule  should have guidance in how to do so . Additionally, weather,  mobility and safety concerns may make it impractical to leave the building to smoke, especially   after dark . Indeed, one testimonial in HUD™s g uidebook specifically describes elderly residents  lacking a safe, outdoor location in which to smoke due to inadequate street lighting by the  locality.  The rule  or accompanying guidance  should make it clearer what accommodations are  possible for various pr operty configurations and how best to allow residents safe alternatives.  IV.  Conclusion  This proposed rule is an important step  toward  making public housing safer and healthier for residents  while reducing property damage and operating costs. By providing  further clarity on the issues outlined  above and empowering PHAs to adapt smoke -free policies to the needs of residents, HUD can build on  the success of the early adopters of smoke -free policies.

       " '      Rhode Island Department of Health    Tobacco Control Program   3 Capitol Hill, room 409   Providence, RI 02908         To: Regulations Division, Office of General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development     From: Rhode Island Live Smoke Free project       R e: Proposed No Smoking Rule for PHAs [Docket No. FR 5597 - P - 02] RIN 2577 - AC97             Instituting Smoke - Free Public Housing     Date: January 15, 2016   ______________________________________________________________________________     The Rhode Island Department o f Health  comments about the  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  proposed no smoking  rule in December 2015.  T wenty five participants   attended the forum.  Of the twenty five participants ,  six were PHAs with no smoking building policies in place. Other participants were affordable multi - unit housing administrators with and without a no smoking policy in place.      On behalf of the  forum participants , Live Smoke Free  is pleased to submit comm ents to the  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) regarding the proposed no smoking rule .  Below see comments for the specific questions for instituting smoke - free public housing.       HUD QUESTION 1. What barriers could PHAs encounter in implemen ting smoke - free housing? What  costs could PHAs incur? Are there any specific costs to enforcing such a policy?     Barriers for PHA s   in implementing a smoke - free housing policy include resident resistance   which   may  cause conflicts between smoking groups vs. n on - smoking groups, enforcement may be challenging in  the evening and on weekends when there is limited staff.      There is a cost to develop and maintain a designated smoking areas that is safe. Costs to develop a  designated area may include outdoor metal si gns, benches, gazebo, lighting, cigarette receptacles  and maintenance throughout the seasons.       If there is a designated smoking area outside, it may be difficult for elderly residents and residents  with limited mobility to get to the designated areas.     P roviding cessation services that meet the needs of smoking residents may be a barrier. Some PHAs  that adopted a no smoking policy received on site cessation services through a grant which is no  longer available. On site cessation groups for smokers who wan t to quit would be ideal given the  transportation barriers.      Cost associated with implementing and enforcing a no smoking policy include increased staff time to  survey residents, facilitate educational resident meetings, supplies for meetings such as  r efr eshments, printed educational materials and resident incentives to attend informational  meetings.        Specific enforcement costs include increased staff time for monitoring, complaint investigation and  possible legal fees.      HUD QUESTION 2. Does this propo sed rule adequately address the adverse effects of smoking and  secondhand smoke on PHAs and PHA residents?     This proposed rule does adequately address the adverse effects of smoking and secondhand smoke  on PHAs and PHA residents.  The data about the danger s of secondhand smoke in the proposed rule  supports the benefits of a no smoking rule and can be used to educate residents.       An exemption for Hookah in the proposed rule will make enforcement difficult. Hookah should be  included in the rule for a more co nsistent rule restricting tobacco use and combustibles.       The proposed rule should include properties with mixed HUD financing in order to protect residents  from secondhand smoke exposure.      A no smoking policy with a 25ft buffer zone may not be a far eno ugh distance to protect secondhand  smoke from drifting back into the building through the entrance way, windows and or balconies. The  rule could propose a buffer range to be determined by site with a minimum of 25 feet     50 feet.  Some Rhode Island Public H ousing Authorities with an existing no smoking policy have a buffer that  starts at 50 Feet from the building.      A minimal buffer can lead to smoke drifting into the building through the entrances and windows.    omplaints of secondhand smoke drifting into  apartments from outside through windows.        Properties with mulch are at an increased risk of fire if smoking is allowed close to the property.         HUD QUESTION 3. Does this proposed rule create burdens, costs,   or confer benefits specific to  families, children, persons with disabilities, owners, or the elderly, particularly if any individual or  family is evicted as a result of this policy?     The proposed rule may create homelessness and burden individuals and or  families evicted as a  result of non - compliance.  Finding alternative public housing for residents who are evicted may be  challenging.      PHAs will need to allocate staff time to monitor the policy, confer with legal, complete legal  paperwork and face possib le court fees as part of the enforcement process.     The benefits of the proposed rule are many, most notably a healthier environment for employees  and residents. Children and babies will be protected from secondhand smoke and third hand smoke  exposure.      Co st savings from decreased renovations of smoking units will be significant.  Non - smokers will not  be subjected to secondhand smoke exposure through ventilation ducts and common areas.       PHAs will not receive move requests from residents bothered by cigare tte smoke; particularly  children and elderly residents who are more affected by smoking.        There may be cost savings by not having to do air quality tests for residents who complain about the  smell of smoke and decreased air quality.       Promoting cessati on may prompt smokers to quit. Residents who want to stay in their housing may  quit smoking.        HUD QUESTION 4. For those PHAs that have already implemented a smoke - free policy, what   sts?     Most of the participants in the Proposed Rule Forum have no smoking policies in place. Participants  indicated that they did not have exceptions and did not have grandfathering as part of their policy.  Some did not enforce smoking within the buffer zo ne  during inclement weather.       PHAs received requests from residents to designate a smoking area with a roof/coverage and  lighting.        A PHA in the no smoking policy implementation process received a move request from a bed bound  smoker. Flexibility with  resident transfers may assist smoking residents with significant mobility  challenges.     HUD QUESTION 5. For those PHAs that have already implemented a smoke - free policy, what  experiences, lessons, or advice would you share based on your experiences with imp lementing and  enforcing the policy?     The most common words of advice  are   the importance of education. Education about secondhand  smoke, cessation services and the benefits of a no smoking policy prior to policy implementation and  continued throughout the p rocess.       Engage residents throughout the policy adoption process. Include residents on the committee to  implement the policy, as well as having resident advocates is very helpful.       Enforcement is easier if you have a 100% smoke free property/campus.     O ffer resident smokers who quit smoking incentives such as the opportunity to have the apartment  cleaned and or painted.        Promote the quitline number and encourage smokers to participate in cessation services. Some PHAs  had residents who enrolled in cess ation and were able to quit.      Offering cessation classes on - site is a big benefit for residents with limited transportation and  mobility. On - site classes are extremely limited and may no longer be available.      There are costs associated with a designated  smoking area but it can help with compliance.       HUD QUESTION 6. For those PHAs that have already implemented a smoke - free policy, what tobacco  cessation services were offered to residents to assist with the change? Did you establish partnerships  with exte rnal groups to provide or refer residents to these services?     Some PHAs offered on - site cessation classes through an external partnership with the state health  department at no cost. This was a time limited resource which ended.      There are some resources  available to assist with cessation services such as local colleges, pharmacy  programs and the health department. More cessation resources are needed and on - site services is  preferred.      Partnerships with the external agencies like the health department tha t coordinates the state  quitline is recommended.       HUD QUESTION 7. Are there specific areas of support that HUD could provide PHAs that would be  particularly helpful in the implementation of the proposed rule?     Specific areas of support that HUD could pro vide that would be helpful include funding for  designated smoking areas (gazebo, bench, and receptacles).      Resources to provide staff training on conflict resolution, mediation and compliance. Also, resources  to provide on - site cessation programs would be   very helpful.     HUD QUESTION 8. Should the policy extend to electronic nicotine delivery systems, such as e - cigarettes?     E - cigarettes are unregulated and some research indicate the presence of formaldehyde and other  harmful toxins being emitted. There are  concerns about fire risk due to e - cigarette lithium batteries  exploding.       More information is needed about electronic cigarettes however a majority of the Forum  participants agreed that it should be included in the policy along with medical marijuana and   hookah.     One participant did not think the policy should extend to e - cigarettes from a harm reduction point of  view.      HUD QUESTION 9. Should the policy extend to water pipe tobacco smoking? Does such smoking  increase the risk of fire or property damage?     Yes, water pipe tobacco smoking should be included in the policy. Water pipe tobacco smoking poses  a fire risk and property damage. Water pipes can be used for marijuana ingestion, which creates  another challenge for enforcement.     ',\n",

Antonovich Fifth District On behalf of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health I am writing to express our strong support for the U.S. Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) proposed rule instituting smoke-free public housing policies as outlined in Docket No: FR 5597P-02. The need for smoke-free public housing is great. Public Housing Authority (PHA) residents are part of our country's most vulnerable populations: the poor, the young, the elderly, the physically disabled, and those with severe mental illness, chemical dependency, and chronic disease. Already facing health inequities, these residents are regularly and unwillingly exposed to the toxins of secondhand smoke in their homes. The proposed rule is a critical step in protecting PHA residents across the country from the adverse effects of smoking and secondhand smoke exposure. The ruling could be further strengthened by including all tobacco products like e-cigarettes. The safety of cigarettes has not been proven and research is beginning to suggest that harmful chemicals in the liquids and secondhand aerosol could cause serious health complications, such as cancer. Similarly, we strongly support including a prohibition on Hookah (waterpipe tobacco) smoking in HUD's final smoke-free policy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the risks of smoking hookah tobacco are similar to the health risks of smoking cigarettes, including exposure to nicotine, carbon monoxide, and other causing chemicals. The secondhand smoke from the burning of charcoal and tobacco contains high levels of toxins that can cause serious health problems like cancer and heart disease. Instituting Smoke-free Public Housing Docket No: FR 5597---P---02 January 15, 2016 Page 2 Finally, we recommend that HUD provide support and resources to housing authorities through grants or pilot projects to implement programs connecting residents to tobacco cessation services. We firmly believe smoke-free policies or regulations of any kind should be paired with resources and supportive services for smokers to encourage quitting. Such resources are critical to the successful implementation of the proposed ruling. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has worked closely with both the Housing Authority of the County of Los Angeles (HACoLA) and the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA) in their efforts to implement HUD's smoke-free public housing guidelines. DPH provided much needed support in connecting the housing authorities to cessation resources as well as community educational materials such as signage to effectively implement their respective smoke-free policies. We believe our partnerships with both HACoLA and HACLA will prove to be best practice models for smoke-free policies in public housing and recommend that HUD encourage such partnerships with housing authorities and public health departments across the country.

       " 'PUBLIC Hawai\\'i Public Health Institute Comment on HUD\\'s proposed rule Instituting smoke-free public housing Docket No. FR 5597-P-02 January 19, 2016 ._ .. HAW AI\" I PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTI; C Thank you for the opportunity to provide comment. The Coalition for a Tobacco-Free Hawai\\'i (CTFH) is a program of the Hawai\\'i Public Health Institute (HI PHI) that is dedicated to reducing tobacco use through education, policy, and advocacy. With nearly two decades of history in Hawai\\'i, the Coalition has led several campaigns on enacting smoke-free environments, including being the first state in the nation to prohibit the sale of tobacco and electronic smoking devices to purchasers under 21 years of age. HI PHI applauds HUD\\'s initiative to require all public housing agencies (PHA) to implement smoke-free policies. Furthermore, HI PHI strongly supports a mandate (as opposed to a voluntary approach), that aims to protect all public housing residents from the dangers of secondhand and thirdhand smoke. In response to the proposed rule, HI PHI respectfully recommends the following: 1. Expand the definition of \"lit tobacco products\" to include electronic smoking devices and hookahs. 2. Include language that identifies all indoor, outdoor, and enclosed \"restricted areas\" and exempt parking lots as a designated smoking area. Additionally, this document includes a brief summary of experiences and lessons learned from our State efforts to address smoke-free public housing, and suggestions for how HUD can support PHAs as they transition toward smoke-free living. http://hiphi.org Ł Sso Richards Street1 suite 201 Ł Honolulu1 Hawai\\'i g6813 HAW AI. I PUBLIC CTFH Recommendations ........... HAWAI\\'I PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE$ CTFH respectfully requests the consideration of the following recommendations: 1. Expand the definition of \"lit tobacco products\" to include electronic smoking devices and hookahs. In the proposed rule, paragraph (c) of§ 965.653 defines lit tobacco products as \"those that involve the ignition and burning of tobacco leaves, such cigarettes, cigars, and pipes\" CTFH applauds HUD\\'s proposal to prohibit at minimum the use of all lit tobacco products.  In addition, CTFH would like to request the inclusion of prohibiting of electronic smoking devices as an electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) and waterpipe tobacco smoking (referred to as hookahs). The Hawai\\'i State Legislature has taken steps to regulate the use and possession of cigarettes to protect the public as well as reduce youth initiation to nicotine and tobacco products. Hawaii\\'s statutory laws were amended in 2016 to include electronic smoking devices as part of the State\\'s laws on smoking and tobacco-free laws. In addition, the statutory definition of electronic smoking device includes the use of hookah pipes and pens. The statutory definitions are included below: Hawai\\'i state law in HRS 328J-1, has included the definition of smoking to include electronic smoking devices as of January 1, 2016: \"Smoke\" or \"smoking\" means inhaling, exhaling, burning, or carrying any lighted or heated tobacco product or plant product intended for inhalation in any manner or in any form. \"Smoking\" includes the use of an electronic smoking device. Further, \"electronic smoking device\" is defined as: any electronic product that can be used to aerosolize and deliver nicotine or other substances to the person inhaling from the device, including but not limited to an electronic cigarette, electronic http://hiphi.org Ł Sso Richards Street, suite 201.

Include language that identifies all indoor, outdoor, and enclosed \"restricted areas\" and exempt parking lots as a designated smoking area. In the proposed rule, paragraph (a) of§ 965.653 defines interior common areas and outdoor areas as \"including but not limited to hallways, rental and administrative offices, community centers, day care centers, laundry centers, and similar structures.\" CTFH acknowledges HUD\\'s efforts to ensure protection from secondhand smoke (SHS), and respectfully requests that specific language be included to offer a definition of all common areas as well as to exempt parking lots from places where smoking areas may be designated by PHAs. Often, parking lots become default smoking areas when properties prohibit smoking on its premises, and including parking lots as a restricted area will further protect individuals that get in and out of their cars from drifting secondhand smoke. Hawaii\\'s statutory definition in HRS §356D-6.5 of \"common areas\" include: roofs, halls, sidewalks, corridors, lobbies, stairs, stairways, fire escapes, entrances and exits of the building or buildings, basements, yards, gardens, recreational facilities, parking areas, storage spaces, and other parts of the project or household normally in common use or other areas designated by the authority. Smoke-Free Housing in Hawai\\' i In 2014, Hawaii\\'s state legislature enacted a law prohibiting smoking in all public housing throughout the state affecting more than 80 properties. This rule provides protections from smoking in all indoor private and common areas as well as outdoor common areas and within 20 feet of buildings and common areas on properties that are managed by the Hawai\\'i Public Housing Authority (HPHA). Through an iterative process, the HPHA administration partnered with the Hawai\\'i State Department of Health (DOH) Tobacco Prevention and Education Program http://hiphi.org Ł 8so Richards Street1 suite 201Ł Honolulu1 Hawai\\'i g6813 PUBLIC INSTITUTE ·-.. HAWAI\\'I PUiiliC HEALTH INSTITV !J (TPEP), Public Health Nursing Branch (PHN) and the Hawai\\'i Public Health Institute (HI PHI) to realize the goal of smoke-free living in all public housing projects in the State. One immediate challenge experienced was staff and resident engagement. To address this challenge, the four agencies, including the Chief Planner within the HPHA administration and the Branch Chief of public health nurses, collaborated on a strategy to engage staff via a general well ness initiative. This well ness initiative, carved out as a new agenda item during monthly manager meetings, took the shape of guest presentations on topics that property managers identified as priority topics such as falls and the elderly, food handling, and other areas of interest. Ultimately, this project provided a space for interaction between staff and administration on the topic of well ness and public health. This space fostered new relationships and trust. Though the program continues to evolve, the goal for this initiative is to create a process that would facilitate and streamline the implementation and enforcement of smoke-free policies. Prior to this wellness initiative, engaging staff on the topic of smoke-free policies proved to be arduous. lessons learned 1. Leadership and Community Involvement. The initial success of this initiative could not have been possible without the involvement from strong champions from the key collaborative organizations such as the Chief Planner at public housing and Branch Chief of public health nursing. The collaborative group also worked with a community champion who was one of the public housing residents and was able to successfully voice out her community\\'s concerns to the state legislature. These individuals helped to expedite processes and overcome obstacles that would not be surmountable without their buy-in. 2. Discuss Smoke-Free Housing through a General Wellness Approach. One key lesson learned was not to immediately approach the topic of smoke-free policies directly. Approaching the topic of smoke-free policies without first generating stakeholder buy-in may have been http://hiphi.org Ł Sso Richards Street1 suite 2m Ł Honolulu1 Hawai\\'i g6813 PUBLIC INSTITUTI; ·-\"\\' HAWAI\\'I PUBliC HEALTH INSTI TU G overwhelming or off-putting to some. Smoke-free housing may be better introduced when framed as part of a broader wellness agenda that would benefit the entire community. 3. Building Relationships and Trust. One key best practice that proved successful in engaging stakeholders was the approach of listening versus telling to establish a better rapport with PHA staff. Establishing a space where PHA staff and other stakeholders can voice their concerns and offer suggestions for learning and technical assistance was a key engagement strategy that helped to form partnerships and promote better communication. 4. Public-private partnerships are key. Whereas the delivery of programs to improve resident health and wellness is difficult when budgets are tight, the collaboration among the four state agencies and community organizations were critical in the sharing of human and fiscal resources. Further, this collaborative approach resulted in defining shared goals and outcomes that were key to this initiative. Technical Support from HUD Some helpful resources that HUD can provide PHA\\'s: 1. Signage Production and Placement Ł Lease addendum language and forms Ł Signage templates in high resolution formats for printing Ł Recommendations on sign placement and production Ł Funding for signage production Ł Decals to be used in common areas, doors, trash cans, etc. Ł Templates for flyers 2. Technical Assistance Ł Press release templates http://hiphi.org Ł 8so Richards Street1 suite Ł Honolulu1 Hawai\\'i ........... HAW A I\\' I PVOliC HEALTH INSTITUTE$ Ł Special assistance and training for educating the residents, particularly the elderly and consumers of mental health services about smoke-free policies and cessation services Ł Webinars and trainings on implementation and enforcement Ł Regular resources accessible online that offer tips, strategies, and best practices on implementation and enforcement Ł Listserv for managers to share resources with one another Ł Option to provide feedback and request for technical assistance Ł PSA\\'s and public education on smoke-free housing Ł Technical assistance from HUD regarding liability with conducting cessation resources onsite and other compliance issues Closing HUD\\'s endorsement of smoke-free policies has far-reaching effects on community public health. A bold step to mandate smoke-free policies in all public housing impresses upon the broader community that secondhand and thirdhand smoke in the home and common resident areas are not tolerable. As part of our vision to protect all family and children from the dangers of smoking, the Coalition for a Tobacco-Free Hawai\\'i is in strong support of this initiative as we believe that this mandate will create the urgency needed for other agencies to follow suit. Further HUD\\'s may continue to demonstrate support for smoke-free policies in the form of technical assistance and education to facilitate successful transitions in public housing authorities. CTFH and HIPHI looks forward to seeing this being implemented in other PHAs across the nation.

Miller, M.D. Acting State Health Officer January 14, 2016 Department of Housing and Urban Development 451 7th Street S.W., Room 10276 Washington, DC 20140-0500 Dear Secretary Castro: Re: Instituting Smoke-Free Public Housing Docket No. FR 5597-P-02 The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) supports the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) proposed rule to restrict smoking in public housing. ADPH applauds HUD for this effort to protect the health and well-being of its residents and staff by proposing a nationwide smoke-free housing campaign. This proposed rule will improve the health of disparate populations  across the country. Reducing the public health risks associated with tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke is foundational to providing safe and healthy housing. Because there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke, the only way to protect against the dangers of drifting secondhand smoke between units is the implementation and enforcement of 100 percent smokefree environments. Attached are questions ADPH considered during its discussion of the proposed free housing policy implementation. TMMIVM/WW Attachment Sincerely, Thomas M. Miller, M.D. Acting State Health Officer The RSA Tower Ł 201 Monroe Street Ł Montgomery, AL 36104 P.O. Box 303017 Ł Montgomery, AL 36130-3017 What barriers could a Public Housing Authority (PHA) encounter in implementing smoke-free housing? Communication with and buy-in from staff and residents are essential elements to successful smoke-free policy implementation. Barriers to implementation can be reduced by using planning tools such as those developed by Live Smoke Free and its parent organization, the Association for Nonsmokers-Minnesota. This group promotes smoke-free policies in apartment buildings, condominiums, and other forms of housing and provides step-by-step strategies that can be c ustomized by any PHA. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 16.8 percent of the population smokes .1 Almost 90 percent of nonsmokers say they have a smoke-free policy at home, and 48 percent of smokers also have a similar rule.Z Thus, it can be concluded that only a very small population of United States (U.S.) residents allow smoking in their homes. What costs could PHAs incur? Costs incurred by PHAs are best measured as savings lost without smoke-free policies. Tobacco smoke is composed of numerous types of gasses and particulate matter, including carcinogens and heavy metals, like arsenic, lead, and cyanide. Thirdband smoke is the sticky, highly toxic particulates from this smoke (like nicotine) and can cling to walls and ceilings. It can be absorbed into carpets, draperies, and other upholsteries causing damage to walls, doors, windows, woodwork, counters, and appliances. Thirdhand smoke is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to remove and can mean tens of thousands of dollars in painting and replacement costs. With the proposed policy, PHA owner/managers will no longer pay exorbitant property damage and residence rehab costs. This, in turn, will save residents and taxpayers money. Smoke-free subsidized housing would save $521 million a year.3 Smoking-related fires are the leading cause of fire-related deaths. Smoke-free policies wiJl reduce fire hazards and the risk oflawsuits due to injury, death, and property damage. In addition, some property insurance companies give policy discounts for smoke-free properties. Indirect costs for smoke-free housing implementation are minimal, built into administrative staff time, and consist primarily of communications with residents and customizing pre-and post-implementation materials. Are there specific costs to enforcing such a policy? Smoke-free policies and enforcement information should be clearly written and included in lease agreements. These policies would be enforced in the same manner as other PHA policies and would incur no specific cost burden. Does this proposed rule adequately address the adverse effects of smoking and secondhand smoke (SHS) on PHAs and PHA residents? In 2006, the U.S. Surgeon General concluded that there is no risk-free level ofSHS and that eliminating smoking in indoor spaces is the only effective way to fully protect nonsmokers from the adverse effects of SHS exposure.4 SHS in multi-unit housing can travel from other units and common areas through doorways, plumbing, and ventilation systems. Implementing the proposed smoke-free policies would prevent SHS from migrating from one unit to another. Raising children in smoke-free environments will lower their risk for developing asthma, pneumonia, bronchitis, and ear infections. According to the 2014 Surgeon General\\'s Report, SHS exposure is known to cause strokes, lung cancer, and heart attacks in nonsmokers.5 1 Does this proposed rule create burdens, costs, or confer benefits specific to families, children, persons with disabilities, owners, or the elderly, particularly if any individual or family is evicted as a result of this policy? Smoke-free policies confer benefits to families, children, persons with disabilities, owners and the elderly by protecting them from SHS, a known cancer-causing substance. Exposure to SHS from burning tobacco products causes disease and premature death among nonsmokers.4 Each year, SHS exposure is responsible for an estimated 7,330 deaths from lung cancer and more than 33,950 deaths from heart disease among U.S. adult nonsmokers.5 In a 2010 journal article, Dr. Jonathan P. Winickoff states that \"tobacco smoke exposure in public housing is particularly troubling because it afflicts disadvantaged and vulnerable populations.\"6 In \"Developing a Smoke-Free Multi-Unit Housing Program, A Guide for Tobacco Control Professionals,\" it is noted renters in public housing often have low incomes and chronic health problems.7 Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S., killing more than 480,000 people annua1ly.8 Tobacco smoking has many adverse effects on the body and is the cause of many diseases such as, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and respiratory disease. There are many benefits to implementing the proposed rule. SHS has more than 7,000 chemicals.9 Many of these chemicals are toxic and cause cancer. According to the 2006 Surgeon General\\'s report, nonsmokers who are exposed to SHS increase their risk of developing heart disease by 25-30 percent and their risk of developing lung cancer by 20-30 percent.10 The proposed rule would help to improve the overall health of smoking residents and nonsmoking residents that are exposed to SHS. Evidence shows that smoke-free policies are associated with reductions in tobacco-related morbidity, including hospitalizations due to acute cardiovascular episodes.\\'\\' According to studies, approximately 56 percent of multi-unit housing residents would support the implementation of smoke-free policies.\\' According to a 2009 survey of renters conducted by Live Smoke Free, 73 percent said they wanted a policy that would cover all ofthe residential units, with 64 percent asking for the entire property to be smoke free.13 What cessation services are available? All 50 states have access to quitline services. Quitlines are telephone-based tobacco  cessation services that help tobacco users quit. Services offered by quitlines include coaching and counseling, referrals, mailed materials, training to healthcare providers, web-based services, and in some instances, free d. .  h . . I I 14 me IcatJOns sue as mcotme rep acement t 1erapy. Are there specific areas of support that HUD could provide PHAs that would be particularly helpful in the implementation of the proposed rule? When the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) implemented a tobacco-free campus policy, we found it useful t o provide outdoor signs and signs at building entrances informing staff, visitors, and clients of the policy. Signs provide a permanent reminder of the policy and reinforce the standard. It was also helpful to include information on 1-800-QUIT-NOW, the Alabama Tobacco Quitline, which offers free help to quit tobacco use. Offering free cessation treatment helps current tobacco users comply with the policy and demonstrates the agency\\'s commitment to the individual\\'s health and well being. 2 In addition to the provision of signs and information on cessation services, local county health departments were provided technical assistance on implementing tobacco-free campus policies through the Department\\'s Tobacco Prevention and Control Program. HUD can provide training on its smoke-free housing tool kit, \"Change is in the Air\" to local housing authority staff and residents. ADPH found that providing training and technical assistance before the policy was implemented greatly improved acceptance and compliance with the new tobacco-free campus policy. Should the policy extend to electronic nicotine delivery systems, such as e-cigarettes? Multi-unit housing smoke-free policies should include electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) such as e-cigarettes. E-juice from these products can be harmful and even deadly.15 While not a common event, e-cigarettes have been known to spontaneously combust, increasing the risk for physical damage to the user as well as property.16 There is also evidence to suggest that certain types of ENDS can be used to smoke illegal substances such as marijuana17 and that the use of ENDS and waterpipes may be closely linked with abuse of other substances.18 According to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, \"allowing e-cigarette use in smoke-free places makes enforcement of smoke-free laws more difficult, requiring business owners and officials to distinguish between e-cigarettes and regular cigarettes and possibly encouraging cigarette smokers to flout the law.\"19 Currently, there is no federal regulation on these products, their contents, or the levels of nicotine they contain. Should the policy extend to waterpipe tobacco smoking? Does such smoking increase the risk of fire or property damage? The coal used in the tobacco heating process produces carbon monoxide, a toxin. If not disposed of properly, the coal can be a fire hazard. SHS from a waterpipe or hookah contains the same cancer-causing · chemicals found in SHS from cigarettes and cigars?0 A single hookah or waterpipe session can produce toxicants equivalent to that of at least one and as many as 50 cigarettes?\\' Hookahs are a serious risk to nonsmokers too, particularly because not only do they produce SHS from the user, but also smoke from the burning charcoal. SHS from a hookah also moves between apartment units, attaching to surfaces (carpets, curtains, tiles, counter tops, etc.) in the same way as cigar or cigarette smoke. 3 1Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Room 10276, Washington, DC 20410-0500 RE: Instituting Smoke-Free Public Housing [Docket No. FR 5597-P-02] Dear Sirs or Madams: The Asheboro Housing Authority (AHA) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule for Instituting Smoke-Free Public Housing published on November 17, 2015. The following comments are AHA\\'s recommendations regarding the proposed rule. AHA opposes establishing the UNFUNDED MANDATE to establish smoke-free public housing. In general, if the proposed rule is established it will be difficult, if not impossible to enforce, increase operating costs for PHA and cause many residents to lose their housing, among others. If HUD decides to adopt the proposed rule and UNFUNDED MANDATE implementation AHA asks the following recommendations be included: Ł Allow PHAs to \"grandfather\" current public housing residents exempting them from the rule. Ł The smoke-free policies in public housing should continue as VOLUNTARY only and should not be MANDATED, particularly due to the fact that it is an UNFUNDED MANDATE. Unfunded Mandate Would Negatively Impact PHAs: AHA supports the Department\\'s goals of improving indoor air quality in public housing in order to benefit the health of residents, to reduce the risk of catastrophic fires and lower overall maintenance costs. At this time PHAs are permitted to implement smoke-free policies voluntarily and many have done so. The proposed rule, however, would not be voluntary and would MANDATE the following very specific requirements including but not limited to: Ł Smoke-free housing policies for ALL public housing authorities (PHAs ), including scattered sites and single family prope1iies. The rule does not apply to dwelling units in mixed-finance buildings which is a double standard; 1 Ł Policies must be implemented no later than 18 months from the effective date of the final rule; Ł Smoke-free includes the prohibition of lit tobacco products in all living units, common areas, administrative offices and all outdoor areas up to 25 feet from the housing and administrative office buildings; Ł Smoking bans must be included in a tenant\\'s lease, either through an amendment process or at lease renewal; and Ł No PHA will be authorized to approve any reasonable accommodation to any resident which would allow that resident to smoke in a unit. These UNFUNDED MANDATED policy changes would take significant work time away from the primary mission of AHA\\'s staff to house low-income families and to maintain this housing in a safe, decent and affordable manner. At present, AHA is faced with a reduced budgetary environment and steady increases in administrative and regulatory requirements required by HUD. The non-smoking UNFUNDED MANDATE is umeasonable, particularly in view ofthe current funding environment of approximately 84% pro-ration of the Operating Fund and Capital Funding that has been basically \"flat\". HUD seeks comments on specific topics and AHA will address these below: Barriers to implementation: Ł Instituting smoke-free policies in public housing should continue as VOLUNTARY only and should not be MANDATED, particularly due to the fact that it is an UNFUNDED MANDATE. Ł Localities should continue to have full local discretion to institute such policies. Ł The current 84% pro-ration budget level will not support staff time needed to implement this UNFUNDED MANDATE without depriving time from the primary mission ofhousing income families. Potential Incurred Costs-Implementation and Enforcement: Ł The rule is an UNFUNDED MANDATE which adds considerable burden, financially and administratively to programs that have consistently received wholly inadequate funding. Ł Enforcement could include administrative time spent educating residents, notifying residents who are out of compliance, termination efforts by an HA, grievance hearings, legal fees and court fees. Ł The Proposed Rule states that \"[a]s proposed in the rule, allowing a resident to smoke in their unit or building common area is not an accommodation that can be granted under  these regulations once effective;\" therefore, populations most likely to be evicted as a result of this ban appear to be the most vulnerable including the elderly, disabled and those struggling with mental illness and mobility impairments. This potential  outcome is too significant to be ignored. 2 Ł There are the potentially significant costs related to unit turnaround as tenants are evicted due to smoke violations, or if they decide to move rather than abide by the new mandate. Ł The increases in vacancies related to evictions and moves outs will directly results in significant increases in maintenance costs as well as and impact on occupancy rates, a HUD priority. Potential Exceptions to the Requirements-Reasonable Accommodations: Ł Unintended consequences and negative impacts will be strongly felt by the residents who could very well face eviction, particularly for persons with disabilities, and especially those with mobility impairments. Ł Populations most likely to be evicted as a result of this UNFUNDED MANDATE appear to be the most vulnerable-the elderly, persons with disabilities, mobility impairments and/or mental illness. Again, this potential outcome is too significant to be ignored. Ł If a reasonable accommodation is not granted, as HUD intends, will the Department defend agencies when residents decide to sue based on denial of a reasonable accommodation? Availability o[Local Tobacco Cessation Services: Ł In general, there appears to be a considerable lack of these services in the AHA service area, not to mention the lack of funding available to assist public housing families. If there were would providing cessation services an eligible cost from the operating budget, or the Capital Fund Program? Need (or Technical Support: Ł Rather than issue a smoke-free UNFUNDED MANDATE, HUD should instead continue to provide tools and technical assistance to those agencies who wish to VOLUNTARILY implement smoke-free policies based on their needs and local discretion. The continuing effort allowing for VOLUNTARY implementation of smoke-free policies has the greatest chance of success and positively impact populations like the elderly, disabled and those with mental illnesses and mobility impairments AHA appreciated the opportunity to comment on this proposed rule and we look forward to HUD\\'s continued rule making process.

We agree that  multi - unit housing should be completely  smokefree, including in all  individual housing units and  common areas, as well as within at least 25   feet   of entrances/operable wi ndows and on balconies/patios.      The U.S. Surgeon General confirmed that  there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke, and  that  secondhand smoke exposure has both short and long term health risks, especially for people with  existing health condit ions like asthma, other respiratory illnesses, heart disease, and cancer. 1   Action is  needed because secondhand smoke does not stay in the unit of a person who smokes. Research  demonstrates that smoke can drift through multi - unit buildings, where it becomes   a nuisance and health  risk to other residents . 2       Prohibiting smoking inside buildings, and measures to prevent secondhand smoke from drifting into   buildings, is the only way to eliminate drifting smoke and effectively prevent  indoor  exposure to this  toxic  substance. 3       Smokefree public housing is a powerful way to have a broad, positive health impact by reducing  secondhand exposure in a location where many people  especially children, the elderly, and individuals  with disabilities  spend much of their t ime, and can suffer from significant levels of  exposure . 4 , 5       Smokefree policies  can  help address health disparities faced by low - income residents and communities  of  color .  Studies show   high rates  of exposure to secondhand smoke in low - income multi - unit ho using,  and lower - income individuals are more likely to have health conditions that are exacerbated by  secondhand  smoke . 6 , 7   A  2015  report  from the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  highlighted the sharp disparities among who remains most  exposed to secondhand smoke in our  communities. 8   The report  found   that 2 in every 5 children  including 7 in 10  African American   children  are exposed to secondhand smoke, and the U.S. Surgeon General has confirmed that the home is the  primary source of expo sure for children. 9   The CDC report also found that  2 in 5   nonsmokers who live  below the poverty level remain exposed, as are  1 in 3   nonsmokers who rent their home. 10     Smokefree policies for public housing are designed to give low - income residents the same r ight to a  healthier living environment that people living in detached homes already have. Everyone  regardless of  their financial situation  deserves to breathe smokefree air where they live, not just people who can  afford to live in a detached house.     The  CDC estimates that between 44% - 46% of non - smokers in the U.S. who live in multi - unit housing and  have their own smokefree home rule are exposed to secondhand smoke coming into their unit from  elsewhere in or around their unit. 11   Similarly, a 2012 national s tudy found that 44% of multiunit housing  residents who do not allow smoking in their home experienced secondhand smoke drifting into their unit  from elsewhere in or around their building in the last year, with 31% reporting that drifting smoke    12    It is clear that people are still being exposed despite their own  no - smoking rules. HUD has the right and responsibility to take action to  protect the health and safety of  its public housing residents from this known health ha zard entering their living space.     Thankfully, smokefree housing policies are able to reduce  secondhand smoke   exposure   and are good for  resident health .  A 2014 study looked at indoor air quality after the Boston Housing Authority implemented  a smokefree  policy.  The study found that not only did particulate levels decrease in units with smokers,  but particulate levels also decreased in units without smokers, which indicates that the smoke had been  entering the nonsmoking units from elsewhere in the buildi ng. 13   A  2012 study from Oregon found that  residents quit smoking at rate of 14.7% in the year after a smokefree policy was implemented in   Portland. This quite rate was a   large increase over the  average rate of  2.6% a year before the policy. The study also found that half of smokers reported  smoking less after implementation. 14    Likewise, r esident surveys  in   30 affordable  housing properties   in  Colorado found a sharp decrease in  secondhand smoke - attributable health   symptoms , as well as   increased quit rates ,   in the year after the buildings implemented smokefree policies. 15      from individuals   who are seeking support  becaus e they are suffering from breathing  secondhand smoke   . While public health advocates can   sary   sustainable public health impact, especially on the most vulnerable residents.      upon  the ongoing  nationwide  efforts of local  jurisdictions and multi - unit property owners and managers that are also adopting smokefree rules   for all  types of multi - unit properties.  From Maine to Minnesota to Washington , public health advocates have  been working for more t han ten years to assist PHAs and privately - owned properties alike in transitioning  their buildings to be smokefree environments. In California, 24 cities and counties have enacted local  laws that require all multi - unit housing to be smokefree, including al l HUD - funded properties. 16    rule would be a crucial piece of the work to    at home ,  whether residents live in public housing, other HUD - funded housing, market - rate apartments, or  condominiums.     Displaceme nt and Enforcemen t  Concerns     We know that there are concerns that a smokefree policy could increase eviction and displacement. ANR  believes that health is a priority that does not have to conflict with the need to have housing security. In  fact, health is a key component of housing se curity.  Public housing residents who are breathing a    especially those with breathing conditions like asthma  are  having their housing security put at risk. Non - smoking residents have the choice to a) continue breathing  a known health hazard in their living rooms and bedrooms, or b) move, which is not often a financial or  logistical reality.         A smokefree housing policy requires that people who smoke go outdoors to do so  they do not  have to move out or quit smoking  but th e smoke -  smoke have to choose between their health and their housing security.          Typically, smokefree housing policies do not result in evictions. Housing providers report that  evictions are very rare, and th e few that occur tend to be due to the resident violating a variety of  lease violations rather than being specific to the smokefree policy.        Smokefree policies are largely self - enforcing when outreach is conducted to educate residents  about why the policy  is being adopted and how they can comply, and when clearly visible signs  are posted about where smoking is not allowed. Management needs to set the expectation of  compliance and treat violations of the smokefree policy like any other lease provision (see  a ttached enforcement advice document). Achieving compliance is a process, and meaningful  outreach to residents early on in the process will help set the stage for it to go smoothly.    meetings  for residents before a  policy is implemented, which is an opportunity for residents to voice concerns, ask questions,  learn what the policy means for them and their family, and get any  misconceptions clarified.    The  process is as important as the policy la nguage. 17 ,   18     Recommendations :     1.   in order for the policy to effectively  cover the full spectrum of lighted and heated products that are intended for inhalation and create  secondhand exposure to non - users  tobacco products including cigarettes, cigars, and waterpipes, as  well as marijuana a nd electronic smoking devices.       : 19        means inhaling, exhaling, burning, or carrying any lighted or heated cigar, cigarette,  or pipe, or any other lighted or heated tobacco or plant p roduct intended for inhalation, including   also includes the use of an electronic smoking device which creates an aerosol or vapor, in any  manner or in any form, or   the use of any oral smoking device for the purpose of circumventing the  prohibition of smoking in this policy.      .  A      clearly  outline   the areas that  HUD intends to include within the scope of this rule. Currently the proposal  would prohibit lit tobacco  products   areas, electrical closets,   storage units, and PHA administrative office buildings   and in all outdoor areas  within 25 feet of the housing   and administrative office buildings .      It is a best practice in tobacco control to  include      to   clarify the intent  and s cope of a smokefree law in order e liminate  ambiguity   or attempts to skirt the law .      Another    guidance   to PHAs that may decide to   outdoor   designated smoking areas, which may include partially e nclosed structures  ANR has   which has resulted in creative and deceptive attempts to build outdoor smoking areas or structures that  more closely resemble an   indoor area than an outdoor space.      We recommend the following definition    : 20        means all space between a floor and a ceiling that is bounded on at least two  sides by walls, doorways, or windows, whether open or  closed. A wall includes any retractable  divider, garage door, or other physical barrier, whether temporary or permanent and whether or  not containing openings of any kind.     3 .  Apply the rule to waterpipes and electronic smoking devices.  ANR strongly recomm ends that the  smokefree rule  be expanded to include   waterpipes and electronic smoking devices in order to protect the  health of nonsmokers and nonusers who are exposed to the emissions from these products. This can be       ordinance.   Please s  recommendation .     4. Specify that the rule will cover balconies, patios, and other attached private use areas.  The  proposed rule covers     which technically may cover the majority of attache d outdoor private use areas, but we recommend  eliminating any ambiguity by specifically stating that  these outdoor spaces   are included in the rule.  A  201 6   study  from the CDC  found that nationwide  61 % of smokers  who live in households with children  do  not s moke inside their  home . 21   Balconies and patios are a key area of focus for smokefree multi - unit  policies because  so  many people today choose to not smoke in their own  home   so as to protect family  and furnishings . Instead ,  they   go out to smoke on a balcony o r patio where their smoke  often   drift s   directly into  adjacent units through   windows, doors, or ventilation ducts.   A significant percentage of  complaints that ANR receives about secondhand smoke exposure in multi - unit buildings comes  from  residents  who are   being exposed  because their neighbors are smoking on a balcony or patio .       5.   Expand the rule to cover Section 8 and other HUD - funded properties.   ANR   encourages HUD to  co nsider expanding this rule  cover  to all properties  that accept HUD funding,  especially   Section 8  properties .  The health, safety, and cost  reasons supporting the   implemen ta ti o n   of   smokefree policies in  public housing  are  just as applicable in other HUD - funded properties.  Everyone deserves to breathe  clean air at home.       6.  Provide   implementation and enforcement   s upport  to   PHAs .   opportunity to allow public housing residents to breathe easier at home if it done in a well - planned and  well - supported manner.       The HUD rule should recommend that PHAs start the  implementation process well before the 18 month  deadline when the policy is required to be in place   so as to allow time for education and fostering  acceptance among residents .  We  also  recommend that  HUD provide PHAs and building managers with  guidance and  support in the form of  education, talking points, and practical tools (sample lease  language, sample letter to residents, steps to take to implement policy, smokefree signs (indoor and  outdoor), enforcement tip   sheet, etc . ) to help them smoothly implement  and enforce their new policies in  a way that promotes understanding  and compliance, and reduces enforcement challenges.      Enforcement is an ongoing process , and PHAs may need support to address issues that come up as  they work to achieve compliance with their residents.  We recommend that HUD create an ongoing  education and support mechanism  through a phone or email hotline, webinars, listserve, or other  appr oaches  to allow PHAs and  property  managers to ask questions and get advice so they feel  confident in implementing and enforcing their policy. ANR  is   happy to help facilitate these  communications , and   ANR and other public health partners, including state an d local  health departments  and  smokefree housing programs, are available to provide technical assistance support to PHAs.     Advance planning and communication with residents are two keys to having a smooth transition to a  smokefree building. Recommendations   for PHAs and property managers include: Let residents know that   smokefree building is beneficial from their perspective: the purpose is to create a cleane r, healthier, safer  living environment for all residents, including people who smoke and their families.      Ask for resident input when planning for the policy to give residents an opportunity to voice their opinions.  Consider conducting a resident survey t o assess their questions and concerns about having a smokefree  building by putting an anonymous survey in each mailbox, or sending it by email. Their responses can  help address concerns head - on before the policy goes into effect.      Communicate what the policy will require residents and their guests to do, how the policy will be  enforced, and consequences are for violating the policy. Send a letter to residents when the policy is  adopted, and again when the policy goes into effect. Ho ld several meeting opportunities for residents  before the policy goes into effect to discuss the policy change to allow residents to voice concerns and  get answers to their questions in person. Provide information about how to access local cessation  resour ces in case residents who smoke are interested in quitting. 22 ,   23     7. Connect PHAs with existing resources.   As stated above, ANR and public health partners on the  national, state, and local level have experience helping housing providers and residents with the process  of implementing and enforcing smokefree policies. Numerous local and state health departments  and  voluntary organizations now have smokefree housing programs  that can   assist housing providers  transition   their properties  to be  smokefree . Tools and support may include hosting meetings for residents  and/or property managers prior to implementation, pr oviding smokefree signage, connect residents and  staff to in - state cessation resources, and lessons learned from other area housing providers.   Support is  available:  PHAs do not have to go it alone .      For example,  ANR has a variety of materials available to   support the adoption of smokefree housing  policies at  www.no - smoke.org/homes.html , including a  sample  smokefree lease addendum ,  several   educational fact sheets for housing providers ,  enforcement recommendations , and an  infographic   on the  be nefits of smokefree housing.    ANR as well as other national, state, and local tobacco prevention  partners have experience working on  smokefree housing policies, and we are excellent resources to  support HUD ,   PHAs ,   and building managers in the process  of   ad opt ing, implementing,   and enforc ing   smokefree policies.       rule is also part of a larger and continually growing national trend to support all types of multi - unit   the availability of smokefree housing for residents of all socioeconomic backgrounds and in all types of  multi - unit housing  from Public Housing, to HUD - assisted properties, to other affordable properties, to  market - rate rentals, to owner - occupied condominiums.      housing residents.

The HACLA fully supports the Department\\'s effort to create living conditions that are free of the effects of first or second hand smoke and have just recently adopted our own smoke-free policy for all of our housing properties, not just our public housing portfolio. Even though we have adopted our policy, we do have concerns as to the directives put forth by the Department in this propose rule, specifically: Ł The rule would limit local agencies discretion to set their policy to best fit their property configuration or to the concerns and full input of stakeholders (residents/advocates); Ł A hard 18-month deadline for compliance; Ł There appears to be inconsistencies regarding reasonable accommodations for disabled or elderly residents; Ł The Department\\'s underestimated assessment as to the administrative burden and cost in administering such a policy; and Ł The Department is once again holding PHAs to higher standard than other federal housing programs. Limit Local Discretion The Department needs to allow PHAs to set policies that will best work for their properties and are reflective of local ordinances and practices. By requiring a 25-foot threshold for allowable outdoor smoking, the Department is restricting such local flexibility. A national standard the threshold required by local setting designated outdoor smoking areas due to HUD should by local not 18-Month Compliance Period needs to provide definition as to it means for a PHA to be \"in full compliance\" with provision within 18-monhts of the effective date. From our own it took us over 18-months of resident and stakeholder discussion prior to being able to adopt a policy. As part of these discussions we agreed to a 24-month phase-in tor the policy prior to enforcement. This was done to provide the Authority and other stakeholders time to educate residents on the policy and to provide ample time and opportunities to direct smokers to smoking cessations programs and resources. A hard 18-month compliance period would not have worked in an agency of our size and complexity. As such, the Department should better define and add  flexibility into this provision of the rule. Reasonable Accommodations This issue was one of the main issues of contention from residents and advocates we experienced while developing our policy. While PHAs will need to make any designated outdoor smoking area accessible, it is not the same as allowing smoking as a reasonable accommodation. The Department appears to provide conflicting messages in the proposed rule and the accompanying Q & A document Specifically, the proposed rule states that: \"A request for a reasonable accommodation from an eligible participant must at least be considered, and granted in appropriate circumstances. To assist PHAs, HUD will work with its Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity develop guidance on accommodating persons with a disability related to smoke-free Administrative Burden and Cost the Department such a policy. PHAs Held to Higher Standards \"HUD determined that the advantages of smoke-free housing policies were sufficient to warrant action by HUD to promote the voluntary adoption of free policies by PHAs and the owners/operators of federally subsidized multifamily properties ... \" Yet, the Department has chosen to mandate only PHAs to adopt such a policy. It is worrisome in this age of reduced funding that the Department would voluntarily place additional administrative burdens solely upon PHAs. If the Department is so concerned about the health and welfare its residents it should require the owners and managers of all federally assisted housing programs to adoption and enforce such a policy, not just PHAs.

Upon in depth and thorough review of the proposed regulation, as the City-Wide Resident Council (or the GGHA, we feel that the policy is an infringement upon a person's rights to peaceful enjoyment in their own home and deciding to smoke and/or not to smoke. We strongly disagree and feel that Public Housing Residents are being singled out and that other federally funded programs are not being told they have to adopt a Non-Smoking Policy. We believe this is a form of discrimination in only requiring Public Housing Residents and not requiring all participants that live in any type of Federal Assisted Housing to adopt a Non-Smoking Policy. We also believe that this will result in additional vacancies for Public Housing because individuals that smoke have indicated that they will be moving if HUD makes the proposed rule a fmal rule as written. Why this may be required for Public Housing residents and not for all other residents of federally subsidized housing regardless of where they get their federal funding? Also, ifHUD does publish a final rule requiring Public Housing to adopt Non-Smoking Policy, we are requesting a written opinion that the rule is not discriminatory and why it is not discriminatory issued by the Office of Fair Housing. We look forward to receiving a response to our comments and questions regarding discriminating against Public Housing Residents.

       " \"I strongly encourage HUD to fully implement a complete and comprehensive no smoking policy  that includes all tobacco products, including those instruments that vaporize condensed  tobacco - replacement products.    Exposure to carcinogens that are passively  left in the environment by smokers creates an  enhanced risk to non - smokers of the same cancer that smokers created for themselves with the  activity. Non - smokers who move into, visit, or participate in activities in enclosed rooms and  buildings are often un willingly exposed themselves to the cancer - causing chemicals left behind  by smokers and vapers.   As stated in a report by the Firefighter Cancel Support Network,   f ollowing the lungs, the skin is   rptive. Some areas of skin are more  permeable than others, specifically the face, the angle of the jaw, the neck and throat and the   temperatu re, absorption increases 40  1    skin  is  the most susceptible organ to  involuntary  smok ing . Everywhere we walk, everywhere we visit,  everywhere we sit, everywhere we job, everywhere we participat e in activities; we have skin  exposed. Anything we can do to decrease or eliminate the presence of known carcinogens to  that exposure is of benefit not just to individuals but to our society as a whole. According to the  nonpartisan Agency for Healthcare Re search and Quality, it is estimated that the direct medical  costs of cancer in the United States, totaling all healthcare   expenditures, is $88.7 billion 2 .  At any  time and place that  you can implement a policy that will decrease those healthcare costs to  re cipients of your services, it is cost efficient to implement that policy.   E -  clothing and the cause of at least one vehicle accident 3 ,   and are flavored by products co ntaining  at least one chemical known as diacetyl which is suspected of causing respiratory illness.   4     Regarding the hazards of hookah smoking, I would remind you that no matter what the use or  purpose of its use, the use of combustion always carries an inherent increased risk of fire.  The  December  2010 Mount Carmel Forest Fire just south of Haifa, Israel,   is a perfect example of the  dangers of hookahs.  A youth admitted to police that he had caused the wildfire through the  negligent disposal of charcoal remnants from a hookah.   5   That fire resulted in hundreds injured,  44 dead, and  over 250   buildings destro yed.   6   This is in addition to the already - present hazards  from hookahs of the same carcinogenic secondhand smoke that is emitted from cigarette  smoking.   Regarding the question about the  cost burden incurred upon residents who are evicted due to  violation o f the proposed rule, how is that perceived burden any different than violations of any  other policy?  If enactment and enforcement of a policy is to be determined by the financial risk  incurred by a resident who elects to create a hazardous environment, th en perhaps all housing  rules should be removed. When a person cho o ses to live within the confines of another who  offers a service or function, that person cho o ses to live within the guidelines and parameters of  their host. I do not see that any person should   be protected to create a hazardous and cancer - causing environment for the simple  reason  that they feel it would be costly for them to be  evicted.   I work  as a captain  for Houston Fire Department in Houston, Alaska. In 2011, our city enacted a  No Smoking po licy for all city facilities, buildings, equipment, and vehicles. At the time of    went from 80%  who smoked to less than 20% within two years. As of today, only 10% of firefighters smoke, and  one is in the process of quitting. There was pushback initially, and that pushback included      environment 7  ng decreased, health improved, and no firefighters quit or  had to be disciplined per the policy.       1   Fir efighter Cancer Support Network   (August 2013).

SHAimplemented smoke free housing across the agency, first within its Seattle Senior Housing Program in2010, then agency wide in all SHA housing in 2012. Our comprehensive implementation processincluded notices to residents as well as supportive measures through various internal and externalpartnerships, peer support groups, and by providing tobacco cessation resources and information to allresidents. Approximately 2/3 of the households we serve are elderly and or disabled. In our 5+years ofimplementing this policy, we have not taken adverse lease action on any tenants. While we have a fewcomments and suggestions below for HUD in developing the final rule, our primary concern is thatHUD allow for maximum local discretion, particularly in light of declining public housing funding, andwithin the shared goals outlined in the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act (QHWRA). Tothat end, we recommend \"grandfathering\" in previously-adopted public housing authority (PHA)policies that meet the same goals. For example, we request that HUD refrain from making \"suggestions\"within the final rule around the placement of designated smoking areas and allow agencies discretion toadopt additional restrictions such as against smoking non-tobacco products (e.g. marijuana) or\"vaping.\"The proposed rule suggestions include that PHAs may want to provide ways in which a resident cansmoke outside of their unit willingly, such as by providing a bench under a roof and under the shade toencourage compliance with the rule. Although this is a suggestion, we believe that some residents mayview the suggestions as requirements which could make future discussion of these issues more difficultshould lease enforcement become necessary, or if the distance between the residence and the alternativeCommissioners Nora Gibson Chair Deborah Thiele Vice-Chair Executive DirectorEmily Abbey Aser Ashkir Kollin Min Zachary Pullin Jermaine Smiley Andrew LoftonSeattle Housing Authority (SHA) CommentsFR 5597-P-02 Instituting Smoke-Free HousingPage 2suggested should be more than residents are willing and able to reach. It would be appropriate toremove any reference to where smoking may occur on PHA property from the Final Rule, and allowhousing authorities to make the determination as to where and if smoking will occur on the properties.In the proposed rule, HUD suggests that accommodations maybe provided to \"residents with mobility-impairment or mental disability.\" In general, smoking is no less harmful to disabled residents whosmoke, and second hand smoke from disabled residents is no less harmful to other residents, than smokefrom residents who are not disabled. Under both Fair Housing and ADA regulations, nicotine addictionis not considered a disability, and smoking tobacco is not a recognized treatment for nicotine addictionor any disability. Residents with mobility impairments may, as an accommodation, need an accessibleroute to designated smoking areas, but disabled residents should not be allowed to smoke in their unitsor on PHA property simply because they are disabled. Furthermore, the determination of disability, andthe need for an accommodation arising from enforcement of a no-smoking policy should be handledthrough the normal accommodation process and procedures within the policies of the PHA. If HUDwill be issuing regulations or guidance concerning how accommodations are to be provided in this area,we ask that HUD recognize the policies which individual PHAs have already instituted regardingreasonable accommodation requests received, in order to reduce placing additional administrativeburdens on agencies. Any guidance without this clarification would make it challenging whenattempting to resolve such accommodation requests.In addition to the above statements regarding disability and accommodations, SHA would like to pointout that there is a high degree of difficulty involved when attempting to enforce no-smoking policies,with regards to lease enforcement and proving smoking violations by residents. It is extremely difficultto carry out lease enforcement and false expectations are created when residents believe that they willlive in a smoke free environment. To that end, SHA recommends that a provision be added to theregulation which includes: (1) the regulation does not guarantee that all public housing will be smokefree; and (2) a PHA\\'s inability to create a smoke free environment shall not be a basis for any claim by aresident for damages against a PHA or relieve the resident from any lease obligation.Thank you for consideration of our comments.Andrew J.Executive',\n",

I  am writing to express my overall  support for the propose d rule, ﬁInstituting Smoke -Free  Public Housingﬂ and  to make specific recommendations for strengthening and implementing it. I am interested  in this rulemaking because of my commitment to ensuring that all Americans have access to housing that is   clean, saf e and healthy. My recommendations reflect the impact and lessons learned from the Minneapolis  Health Department™s involvement with passage, implementation and evaluation of Minneapolis Public Housing   Authority™s smoke -free policy.   In 2012, the Minneapolis  Public Housing Authority (MPHA) passed a smoke -free housing policy for its 42 high  rise buildings. The policy affects 5315 residents, the majority of whom are disabled and/or seniors. MPHA™s   policy includes a prohibition on indoor use of all tobacco produ cts including electronic cigarettes and the  burning of incense. And, it specifies that outdoor smoking must be 25  feet from the building. The policy is built  into lease agreements and is enforced through the same processes as all lease violations.     MHD he lped to communicate the policy to residents and convened community partners and clinics to provide  information about smoking cessation and support residents interested in quitting. MHD and Hennepin County   Public Health conducted a pre and post survey with  1079 residents in 9 of its 42 high rise buildings. The goals  of the survey were to measure smoking status, support for the smoke -free policy and exposure to secondhand  smoke before and after the policy went into effect. The response rates for the pre and p ost surveys were  70.8% and 71.3%, respectively.     Need for smoke -free environments in public housing  The public housing population experiences disproportionately high rates of smoking and exposure to  secondhand smoke. Pre -policy smoking rates across all buildings ranged from 14.1% to 44.8%, with an average  of 22.7% across all 9 buildings (Table 1). This i s far higher than the statewide adult rate of 14.4%. MPHA  residents also experienced high rates of exposure to secondhand smoke in their apartments. Nearly 26% of   residents reported ﬁat least weeklyﬂ exposure to secondhand smoke. These rates are unacceptab ly high,  especially among an elderly population that experiences chronic health conditions.  The only way to protect   against the danger of drifting secondhand smoke between units is 100% implementation and enforcement of a   smoke -free policy. Smoke -free pol icies should not include grandfathering or exempt any residents.    Table 1  Effects of Smoke -Free Policy at Minneapolis Public Housing Authority i    Current Smoking  Smoke enters apt from  somewhere else   (weekly or more often)   Smoke exposure inside apt  (weekly or more often)  Pre Policy Implementation  22.7%  25.9%  21.8%  Post Policy implementation  17.9%  13.4%  6.4%  Rate Difference  4.8%  12.5%  15.4%   Demonstrated impact of smoke -free policies  Smoke -free policies promote health equity among vulnerable populations and groups with higher levels  of tobacco use and exposure. The Hennepin County study shows the significant impact of MPHA™s policy  on its residents. As shown in Table 1, smoking rates d ecreased a statistically significant 4.8%. Residents  reporting smoke exposure from inside and outside individual apartment units also decreased  significantly.     Extending the policy to electronic cigarettes  The HUD policy should extend to electronic cigarettes because they are harmful to health and can  complicate enforcement. Exempting e -cigs sends the message that these products are an acceptable  alternative to cigarettes, when in fact, there is a growing bo dy of evidence suggesting the opposite.  Potentially harmful constituents have been documented in some e -cigarettes and the secondhand  aerosol emitted from e -cigarettes contains heavy metals, ultrafine particles and lower levels of toxins  that are known to  cause cancer. Given the known harms of these products and the unknown harms, it  would be irresponsible to exempt them from the policy. Given health concerns caused by e -cigarettes,  the Minneapolis Public Housing Authority included them in its smoke -free po licy. Residents accepted  this inclusion with little -to-no resistance.    Extending the policy to water pipes and incense  It is imperative that the HUD policy includes water pipes and incense. Hookah use poses serious health   risks to users and those exposed  to smoke. Hookah smoking results in the same health risks as smoking   cigarettes, including exposure to nicotine, carbon monoxide and other cancer -causing chemicals. The  secondhand smoke emitted from burning charcoal and tobacco contains high levels of toxi ns that can  cause or exacerbate serious health conditions such as cancer and heart disease. And because hookah   smoking occurs over a longer period of time than smoking a cigarette, both uses and non -users can be  exposed to more secondhand smoke. Including  hookah pipes in HUD™s smoke -free policy is consistent  with its goals of ensuring safe indoor air for residents.     HUD should also consider including incense in the policy because studies have shown that particulate  matter (small pieces of air pollut ion), hazardous gases like carbon monoxide and volatile organic  compounds are found in incense smoke.  A number of cancer causing chemicals like benzene have also  been found in incense smoke.  Incense smoke exposure could exacerbate respiratory conditions  like   asthma, cause skin irritations, and has been linked to several illnesses. Prolonged exposure may also   increase contact with harmful cancer causing chemicals, hazardous gases and particulate matter.   Incense can be used to mask the smells of cigarettes,  hookah and marijuana, making it difficult to  enforce smoke -free policies. Including incense in MPHA™s policy was controversial because burning  incense is a common culture practice among some East   African populations. Despite residents™ complaints, MPHA i ncluded incense in its policy because of the  health concerns it poses.       Recommendations for Policy Implementation  The following recommendations are based on implementation experience at MPHA:    PHAs should be allocated funds to create safe areas for outdoo r smoking. For one building,  MPHA built a fence -wall to help residents feel safe outside. PHAs should also consider and plan  for timely snow and ice removal to designated smoking areas.    Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) should be provided training and mat erials to respectfully and  effectively communicate the smoke -free policy to staff and residents. The Minneapolis Health  Department and MPHA scheduled trainings for area managers and building managers and they  provided multiple meetings where residents lear ned about the policy, asked questions, shared  their ideas and needs related to smoking outdoors or cessation.  PHAs should provide residents   some influence over decisions that affect them. For example, residents could be included in   selecting designated ou tdoor smoking areas.   PHAs should create a procedures manual that accompanies their policy and outlines specific   roles and responsibilities for various departments (Communications, Property Services, etc.).     Recommendations for Cessation Support  Results fr om the survey show the need and impact of smoke -free policies in public housing.   PHAs should be encouraged to work with their local public health departments or health groups   (e.g., American Lung Association) to assist with cessation activities. Statewide  1-800 quit lines  can be challenging for residents because of language barriers and their phone plans. Residents   are often unaware of basic cessation benefits that are available through government programs   like Medicaid. The Minneapolis Health Department wo rked with the American Lung Association,  local clinics and the on -site social service provider to share information about smoking cessation  options and to link residents to available resources at clinics. The Health Department also   trained on -site social w orkers in tobacco dependence so they understood residents™ challenges  and could effectively support them in their choices.    In summary, I support the proposed rulemaking and suggest that it be strengthened to include e -cigarettes, water pipes and incense.  And I recommend that local PHAs are adequately supported with  funding to successfully implement the policy and support their residents™ needs related to complying  with the policy and quitting smoking, if they choose. As evidenced by the MPHA data, smoke -free  policies will reduce residents™ exposure to secondhand smoke and encourage smokers to quit.     Sincerely,    Gretchen Musicant  Commissioner of Health                                                              i Ding, Y., Mehrotra, K., Hennepin County Community Transformation Grant  Evaluation Team (2015).

My daughter is living in a PHA that has already banned smoking, which is a great stride on paper, but lack of cohesive effort and commitment have severely undermmed the outcome. Because standards for implementation, supervision, and enforcement are so critical to a v1able policy, I recommend the following measures be adopted: HUD should include a review of how each PHA has implemented this policy in its annual or other regular inspection, including a suney of residents on bow the smoke-free policy is working, their suggestions for improving it, and how responsive the PHA aod staff have been. The evaluation process should give incentives for PHA\\'s to improve their record or maintain a high evaluation by HUD in their implementation of the policy. HUD should encourage the creation of Designated Smoking Areas if surveys of residents show interest or demand for such an arrangement to encourage those who still smoke to do so outside the buildings. Every PHA should show active measures taken to accommodate smokers as well as encourage those who are willing to quit smoking. However, HUD should oot aUow electronic cigarettes. as they could be confusing in identifying violations. HUD should include evaluation of and recommendations for how the PHA documents violations, and how they manage situations where a resident may need accommodations to help them comply (such as supplying a resident with nicotine replacement therapy for a length of time while acclimating to the policy, if there are oo other resources for this). Thank you for considering these critical measures to make the Non-Smoking policy a success. Sincerely, Roxanne J.

Over the past thirty plus years w e have represented thousands of  clients who live in public housing or who are seeking to live in public housing.   W e are writing  to   - free public   housing.  While  the concept of smoke - free housing is a laudable public health goal and will be very welcome by  many public housing residents, the policy as proposed poses severe difficulties   and risks  for  many public  housing residents who smoke as well as   other residents   who have guests/aids/other  visitors who smoke.   We suggest that HUD modify the proposed rule, as descri b ed below.       1.   The  f inal  r  comply with the policy.  Homelessness and  lack of stable housing are known serious  dangers   that must be considered and balanced again the public health  and other  goals of the no - smoking policy.   Our primary concern is preventing homelessness due to this policy.       Unstable housing and  homeless ness   are known public health dangers, particularly for children, elderly persons and  persons with disabilities.  Numerous studies document the adverse impact on children.  As  summarized by one study:     Children who are homeless suffer from hunger, poor physical   and emotional health, and   hungry as are children who are not homeless. Homeless children are more likely than  other children to have moderate to severe acute and chron ic health problems, and less  access to medical and dental care. Symptoms of asthma, hyperactivity/inattention, and  behavior problem s   are more prevalent among this group. Homeless children have three  times the rate of emotional and behavioral problems, such   as anxiety, depression, sleep  2     problems, withdrawal and aggression.  Children without stable homes are more than  twice as likely as others to repeat a school grade, be expelled or suspended, or drop  out of high school.   A quarter or more of homeless children   have witnessed violence.     McCoy - Roth, Mackintosh and Murphy   emphasis added) 1 .       The proposed rule requires that PHAs amend their leases to incl ude the smoking ban.   Enforcement  as proposed  in the rules  is through the lease and through eviction. Although some   statements reported in the press  suggest that it anticipates that PHAs will work with  families and avoid evictions, that  notion of  working with residents i s not express ed   in the  proposed regulation.   While some PHAs who have pursued no - smoking policies have instituted  multi - step warnings before eviction, the proposed rule includes no such multi - step  requirement  or lease/policy  languag e. On the contrary, the proposed rule expressly requires that the lease state   Proposed 24 CFR  966.4(f)(i)(B).   In our experience,   many   PHAs enforce lease provision s in a  cut - and - dried   manner  if a resident  violates the lease, the PHA pursues eviction.       Tobacco is highly addictive, and smoking cessation is very difficult, particularly for  many  public  housing residents who may be coping with mental illness, disability, or highly stressful life  circumstances, including financial hardship and family dissolution.    As noted by the American  Psychological Association ,    A mericans with mental illnesses h ave a 70 percent greater  likelihood of smok   eople with mental illnesses also smoke  more often than smokers without mental illness  2     Based on a report done by the CDC,  nearly 1  in 5 adults (or 45.7 million adults) hav e some form   of mental illness and 36% of this group  smok e cigarettes . 3     It  has been shown to produce antidepressant effects and ease anxiety. 4     Nicotine also is known to increase neurotransmitters that affect dopamine, serotonin,  norepinephrine, and epinep hrine.      brain  chemistry   is  sooth ing to  many  indi viduals, especially those with A DHD, anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. 5       Victims of domestic violence are  58% more likely to  smoke   than the general population . 6     Low - income persons generally smoke in higher numbers.   In examining the high rates of smoking  among low -  the stresses of living in  poverty and sometimes hopelessness cause people to turn to cigarettes    S ingle  parents   in poor  neighborhoods are more    ouble jeopardy    with a high burden of childcare  responsibilities coupled with social isolation and the chronic stress associated with neighborhood  poverty. Smoking can be a reliable strate gy to soften those burdens.  7    While t obacco is  decidedly addictive and smoking cessation is extremely challenging   for the general public, m any  p ublic housing residents are faced with even more road blocks to quitting , ranging from  financial                                                      1   http://www.childtrends.org/wp - content/uploads/2012/02/2012 - 08EffectHomelessnessChildren.pdf   2   http://www.apa.org/monitor/2013/06/smoking.aspx   3   http://www.cdc.gov/features/vitalsigns/smokingandmentalillness/   4 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22743591   and    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12151749   5     http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubme d/20109141   6   https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/public - health - now/news/domestic - violence - victims - more - likely - take - smoking .   7   http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/26/opinion/sandel - poverty - smoking/   3     hardship to p ay for treatments   to  transportation difficulties for treatment  to  physical immobility  and inability  to participate in treatment.     Our main point, therefore, is that t his proposed  rule  affects very vulnerable persons   and puts their  home s   and their shot at  s table,  affordable housing at risk due to a lease violation involving a  legal activity that is also highly addictive.     The final rule should not permit eviction as a method  of enforcement.          2.   The final rule should substitute positive incentives for  smoking cessation and for  compliance with the no - smoking policy, as well as assistance with cessation and  compliance, rather than punitive enforcement through eviction.   T he stated reason for implementing the proposed policy is to protect the health of resi dents as a  whole and to reduce risk and costs to PHAs.   The health of residents as a whole will be improved  if tenants who smoke are able to stop smoking.  Residents should not be required to stop  smoking but they should be encouraged to do so, as set forth   below.       Smoking cessation  treatment  programs   and medications   can be expensive, however, and outside  the financial means of many tenants. At the same time, the rulemaking estimates a benefit to  PHAs from the proposed regulation ranging from $48 million t o $70 million in reduced  maintenance and fire risk, and only a $3.2 million implementation cost. The very substantial  savings can be used to support smoking cessation programs. The regulation should require PHAs  to pay the costs of smoking cessation treatm ent and counseling that is not otherwise available to  a tenant/household member.  Attendant costs should also be covered, including costs such as  child care and transportation to needed treatment/counseling. The regulation also should mandate  that PHAs be  expansive rather than restrictive in the cessation treatments and programs they  support, as each smoker is different and will respond to different treatments or programs. The  regulation should recognize that smokers may need to try a number of times to qui t, and PHAs  should be required to cover the costs of repeated treatment and counseling where necessary.     In addition to using the substantial cost savings to pay costs for residents who agree to pursue  smoking cessation, those costs savings should also be  used to support financial incentives for  smoking cessation. We refer you to a study reported in the New England Journal of Medicine  which concluded that financial incentives were effective in increasing enrollment in smoking  cessation programs and in remai ning smoke free.  The financial incentives in that study were  significant but relatively small compared with the costs savings which HUD projects from   informed that t hey would receive financial incentives for completion of a community - based  smoking - cessation program ($100); for smoking cessation, confirmed with the use of a cotinine  test, within 6 months after study enrollment ($250); and for continued abstinence for a n   8   Given the limited income of public  housing tenants, financial incentives in these or similar amounts would be very meaningful. This  carrot approach is desirable both to assist tenants in smoking c essation, and as an alternative to  punitive measures which will have very harmful impact on tenants and their household members.                                                         8    http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa0806819      4     3.   If HUD Insists on Enforcement Through the Lease, the Rule Should Be Clear that  Eviction Must  B e A Last Resort   To avoid the  abo ve - described  damage to residents due to eviction   and loss of  their  affordable  housing , the final rules should at least require that PHAs undertake a multi - step counseling and  warning process to help residents deal with any hurdles and encourage them to com ply with the  policy/access available resources, rather than pursue eviction.      Any other approach lacks  fundamental fairness and improperly penalizes residents.          4.   T he final rule should give P HAs   the option to exclude certain housing units from the  no - s moking policy and require PHAs to create designated smoking areas  when ever  feasible.    The rulemaking specifically states that PHAs should continue to rent to smokers. Smoking is a  legal activity. It is not feasible that all smokers will be able to quit eve n if they are willing to do  so.    It also important to note the  underlying purposes of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937   are   to  prevent homelessness and provide decent housing for all Americans. In order to meet these  objectives, the final rule should allow PHAs discretion to accommodate smokers.      The rule as proposed applies to all types of public housing except mixed finance. The final rule  should give PHAs the discretion to exclude all or a portion of their scattered site units from the  rule.  T he issue of health risk to other tenants from SHS is  not implicated in scattered site  housing.      Similarly, the final rule should allow PHAs which have multiple public housing properties to  designate one or more of those properties as smoking properties. The segregation of units could  be phased in with the r oll out of the new rule. This flexibility has the added benefit of assisting  the PHAs in making reasonable accommodations to smokers with disabilities, who because of  their impairments either cannot stop smoking or cannot leave their units or indoor areas  to smoke  in designated outdoor areas.      Under the proposed rule, PHAs have the option of banning smoking on their entire property  rather than designating an outdoor smoking area. The final rule should mandate a designated  smoking area unless not physically   feasible given the size or configuration of the property. By  banning smoking on the entire property and thereby not giving a feasible option for smoking to  those who are unable to quit, the PHA would be increasing unnecessarily the likelihood that a  smoke r would be in violation of his or her lease. Again, this would be punitive and counter to the       It is frightening to  think of single parents leaving young children unattended to leave th e property to smoke or for  frail elderly or disabled persons to go out in the range of weather and safety conditions that we  have across our country   in order to smoke .      Finally, the final rulemaking should require that the PHA solicit and receive input  fr om tenants  on its decisions in this regard .     5.   The final rule should not hold participants responsible for the actions of their  guests .   5     The proposed rule requires that tena nts    smokes in restricted area s.  Proposed 24 CFR  § 966.4(f)(12 ) (i).  This  language  should be deleted   from the final rule .  The rule should a ffirmatively stat e   that the  tenant is  not responsible for     We propose these changes for  practical rea sons   concerning the difficulties of policing visitors.   C arrying tobacco is legal. P ersons who smoke  usually carry their tobacco products with them and will use them when  they have the inclination  and opportunity.  The proposed ban extend s     Most public  housing properties   include parking lots and outdoor common areas wh ere it would seem  appropriate to be able to smok e .    Persons not in public or subsidized housing will not have  adequate notice to know about the smoking ban and more importantly,  not have notice of  the  consequences to the  residents they are visiting who could be   found in violation of the smoking  ban.     Add itionally,  residents will have no  opportunity to advise   unexpected visitors  about the  ban.        To hold  residents  liable for violation of the smoking ban  by guests exposes them to a   penalty  for   e  at page 45 recommends    the  PHA cannot act as a   - smoking policy.   Just like   PHA s , residents cannot guarantee that their  guests and visitors will comply with the poli cy out of their sight. They  cannot police the actions  of their visitors , especially as they come to and leave the p roperty.       6.   The final rule should include a provision for reasonable accommodations for  physically and/or mentally impaired individuals.   As d escribed above,  there are multiple practical and biological reasons why public housing  residents with physical and/or mental impairments would have  huge challenges in trying to qui t  smoking.   Residents  with physical and/or mental impairments might have seve re limitations that  would affect their ability to quit smoking   and their ability to get to a location where they are  permitted to smoke   in order to remain in the public housing program.  The established  r easonable  a ccommodation framework should apply:  ( 1 ) if  tenant suffer from an impairment that  substantially impairs a major life activity  and affects the ir   ability to comply with the policy ,   ( 2 )   if  the PHA  has knowledge or should have knowledge of   the   impairment ,   (3) if  accommodation  in   is   necessary ,   and (4)  if   the resident requests a ccommodation , then the PHA  should engage in the interactive process with the residents in order to tailor an accommodation  for them.        Potential accommodations can and should include:  allowing residents who ca nnot get to  designated smoking areas to smoke to use balconies or areas outside their homes if available,  additional time for cessation treatment, moving tenants with cessation/ inability to quit smoking  issues to same floors or same buildings or same scat tered sites .  Another  good  option for tenants  with disabilities who cannot stop smoking and cannot get to designated areas is to offer a S ection  8 voucher .     Termination/ eviction for such   residents with disabilities  who request reasonable  accommodations  s hould not be permitted.       It is worth highlighting that this proposed non - smoking policy is a fundamental change to the  program put forth by HUD.  HUD should instruct PHAs to exercise discretion in favor of the  residents when determining whether a request ed accommodation is reasonable or imposes an  6     undue financial or administrative burden.  Moreover, the final rule should make clear that a  resident who continues to smoke is not a direct threat to the health and safety of other residents.     7.   The Final Rule Should Give  PHAs More Flexibility   on the Scope of the No - Smoking  Policy   Various  PHAs have properties that vary in size, configuration, and other factors, like  safety/security.  They may have a large number of scattered site units ,   they may h ave  concentrations of smokers in various locations .  M any factors may play into creating their  smoking policies.  PHAs should have  more  flexibility to create plans that fit their circumstances  and achieve the overall goal of the policy .  Requiring all PHAs   to impose a 25 foot no - smoking  ban from any of its buildings does not make that much sense for scattered site properties, for  example, and may be too rigid for many other smaller properties as well.  We propose that the  final rule give PHAs more flexibil i ty and not impose a 25 foot ban .         8.   The Final Rule Should Require that PHAs Treat the Smoking Ban as a Significant  Plan Amendment and Afford PHAs More Time to Implement Policies   The proposed rule requires PHAs to amend their plans to include no - smoking policies.  The  preamble to the rulemaking, however, leaves it up to PHAs to determine if the smoke free policy  is a significant amendment to the PHA plan.  80 FR 71767.  These new p lans are unquestionably  significant amendments as is clear from the entire undertaking and the huge impact it will have  on all public housing households.  HUD should clarify that the plans must be amended under the  PHA plan amendment procedures set forth i n 24 CFR Part 903.    Requiring PHAs to actively  engage residents will give residents more information about the no - smoking initiative and  achieve better notice and understanding about the policy.        new plan  pursuant to the significant plan amendment process  does not afford PHAs sufficient  time to complete the plan amendment process and adequately inform res idents of the new policy.   We suggest that HUD modify the time frame to 24 months with possible extensions for PHAs  that require additional time.  To develop a policy, PHAs need to do  an analysis of their tenant  populations (how many smoker s   do we have ,   wh at barriers do th ey face due to age, disability,  safety in using designated smoking areas ) ,   an analysis of where s moking areas  could  be located   at various properties,  as well as  their  resources , expertise, and training needs.    As described  above, a   good policy will not only define the rules for smoking and it consequences, but will  assist tenants in  trying to quit smoking.    For  the  policy to be effective, it must provide people  with access to treatment and cession programs.   PHAs  need to analyze wha t resources are  available in the  community  as well at what they can provide to their residents.     All of this   analysis takes time .     The PHA must also work with the Resident Advisory Board and conduct  public meetings to obtain input before finalizing the p lan.         Additionally, residents need adequate advance notice of the new policy once it is finalized.   A ccording to  HUD  Smoke Free Housing: A Toolkit for Owners/Management Agents of  Federally Assisted Public and Multi -  t is recommended that       We believe that this 90 day time frame is too  short to allow residents adequate time to learn about and adjust to the new policy.       7       Extend ing   the timeline does not weaken what HUD is   seeking to do , but will allow residents  greater opportunity for involvement in and adjustment to the new policy.

Private Enterprise. January 19, 2016 Housing Partnership Network (HPN) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Proposed Rule (Docket No. FR5597-P02 RIN-2577-AC97) establishing a smoke-free policy in all public housing. HPN is a member-driven organization comprised of nearly 100 entrepreneurial, capacity nonprofits that operate all across the country. The members are diversified social enterprises combining a mission focus with business acumen. HPN members\\' businesses include multifamily development, lending, property management, and housing counseling. All of our members work to link their communities to services-education, workforce development, and health care. Collectively, HPN members have developed or rehabilitated 374,000 affordable homes, and assisted 9.8 million people through housing, community facilities, and services. HPN is best described as a business collaborative. The members\\' senior leadership comes together with their peers to exchange information, solve problems, and share best practices. Their collaborations have spawned member-owned businesses that improve member operations and advance innovations in the practice of affordable housing and community development. For example, when members realized a need for long-term, low-cost capital they formed a multifamily real estate investment trust (REIT) called the Housing Partnership Equity Trust (HPET). HPET enables its 12 mission-driven nonprofit partners to quickly and efficiently acquire multifamily housing. Other businesses that have emerged from these collaborations include a group buying service and a new web-based approach to homebuyer education. Currently, HPET with its partners manages 10 multifamily properties which provide homes for families, seniors, and others with modest incomes. Additionally, several HPN members who manage large portfolios of affordable multifamily housing, such as Homes for America, have successfully gone smoke-free. Based on the experience of HPET and HPN\\'s members, HPN is supportive of the Department of Housing and Urban Development\\'s (HUD\\'s) proposed rule to implement a smoke-free policy in all public housing because it can serve as a model for all multifamily property managers, deliver substantial cost savings for property managers, and have positive benefits for resident health and safety.

NE, Suite 760, Washington, DC 20002 I P 202-743-7966 www.housingpartnership.net Cost Savings: HPN Letterhead Pagel of3 We believe that Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) taking the lead in going smoke-free will encourage other property managers to go smoke-free and can serve as a model for multifamily residential property management. If other property managers implement this policy it could lead to significant cost savings in the management of multifamily properties. Implementing a smoke-free policy can lead to substantial savings in both maintenance costs and fire-related damage costs. One estimate done by the Smoke-Free Housing Coalition of Maine shows that the cost savings from maintenance is between $770 and $2170 per unit.1 Furthermore, because the smoke-free policy applies to both common areas and outdoor areas, it could also reduce the need for property management staff to clean outdoor and common areas of smoking-related waste including cigarette butts. Smoking within residential buildings also can have serious costs associated with fire damage. A study by the U.S. Fire Administration found that between 2008 and 2010 fire-related damage caused an estimated $326 million in residential property damage.2 Going smoke-free could result in significant cost savings for PHAs from prevention of fire-related property damage and potentially lead to reduced insurance costs. We believe that the cost of implementing this policy will be minimal because PHAs can integrate the check for policy compliance into the inspections which they already routinely conduct. Health and Safety: In addition the negative health effects of secondhand smoke have been well documented by researchers. According to the U.S. Surgeon Generat secondhand smoke causes premature death and disease in children and in adults who do not smoke. Moreover, \"The scientific evidence indicates that there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand smoke.\" (p.11)3 Furthermore, smoking is the number one cause of civilian fire deaths in residential buildings, despite only accounting for two percent of residential building fires. This is a major safety issue for both residents and staff working in multifamily residential buildings. Residents who smoke in a multifamily residential building don\\'t just harm those who live or enter their units but all residents living in the building. According to the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (2013L \"At present, the only means of effectively eliminating health risk associated with indoor exposure is to ban smoking activity.\" (p.3)4 These effects also harm the health of staff working in multifamily residential buildings 1 Smoke-Free Housing Coalition of Maine.

January 19 , 2016  Regulations Division, Office of General Counsel  Department of Housing and Urban Development  451 Ð 7th Street, SW, Room 10276  Washington, D.C.  20410 -0500  RE:  Instituting Smoke -Free Public Housing, Docket No. FR 5597 -P-02  Dear Secretar y Castro:   The Smoke -Free Environments Law Project (SFELP) of The Center for Social Gerontology, Inc.  (TCSG)  of Ann Arbor, Michigan is pleased to submit comments to the U.S. Department of  Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on the proposed HUD regulation t itled  ÒInstituting  Smoke -Free Public Housing Ó.  SFELP/TCSG commends HUD for this important first step in  protecting public housing residents , PHA staff and visitors  from the dangers of secondhand  smoke and in improving the overall conditions of public hous ing throughout the nation.   Background :  SFELP/TCSG, a s a non -profit, public policy  organization based in Michigan, but  also having a national focus, has been a leader in the nation for over 15 years in working on and  assisting public housing authorities ( PHAs), other affordable multi -unit housing providers, and  market rate multi -unit housing providers in adopting and implementing smoke -free policies for  their housing.  Our web site MISmokeFreeApartment.org was one of the first such web sites  focused exclus ively on this issue and was a model for many similar sites that were developed  later.  We also created and manage a smoke -free multi -unit housing list serve that has about 400  members from  virtually  all 50 states and a number of Canadian provinces and incl udes members  from local, state and federal agencies and many PHAs and  health and tobacco control  professionals.   In our home state of Michigan, SFELP has for many years worked closely with the Michigan  Department of Health and Human ServicesÕ (MDHHS) Tobac co Section, which is the key  funding source for SFELP, as well as with local health departments in promoting smoke -free  multi -unit housing for all types of multi -unit housing.  In these efforts we have worked with over  100 of MichiganÕs PHAs and tribal PHA s in adopting and implementing smoke -free housing  policies.  We have also worked closely  on this  with the Michigan chapter of the National  Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials (MI NAHRO) .  The current results of these  efforts are that 73 of 1 24 Michigan PHAs (59%) have adopted smoke -free policies for some or  all their properties, including PHAs with as few as 20 units and some of MichiganÕs largest  PHAs such as Detroit  (over 2500 units) , Lansing  (over 800 units) , and Grand Rapids  (over 900  units), as well as with other PHAs of varying sizes.  Further, we have worked closely with  MichiganÕs 12 Tribal PHAs, with the result that 11 of the 12 have adopted smoke -free policies  (92%).  This has resulted in over 32,000 Michigan public housing residents  being protected from  the health dangers of secondhand smoke, as are the staff of these PHAs.   !#!In addition, SFELP has worked with and assisted PHAs and public health professionals working  on smoke -free multi -unit housing in well over 25 of the U.S. states,  as well as in about 5  Canadian provinces.  SFELP has provided assistance to HUD officials in Washington, D.C., as  well as HUD Regional Office officials, in moving forward in promoting smoke -free public and  other affordable HUD -assisted housing.  SFELP has  provided similar technical assistance to the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and PreventionÕs (CDC) Office of Smoking or Health (OSH),  and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on smoke -free multi -unit housing matters.   At the invitation of HUD,  CDC and EPA, SFELP professionals have made presentations at  numerous conferences and trainings these agencies have sponsored on this topic.  Likewise,  SFELP professionals have made presentations and done trainings on smoke -free multi -unit  housing in over  30 states  and Canadian provinces,  often -times these presenta tions being some of  the first on  this topic done in these states or provinces.   Our comments on HUDÕs proposed smoke -free public housing rule are based on our many years  of working on this issue.   Our comments herein are based on our empirical experiences in  working with  hundreds of  PHAs and other  HUD-assisted affordable housing  providers  throughout Michigan and the nation.  Rather than footnoting our comments, we will present them  as ÒexpertsÓ on  this topic.  We should note that, as a founding member of the national Tobacco  Control Legal Consortium (TCLC), we are also a signatory on the detailed and highly footnoted  comment of this proposed rule which TCLC is submitting, along with Americans for  NonsmokersÕ Rights, the Association for Nonsmokers  Ð Minnesota, the National African  American Tobacco Prevention Network, and the North American Quitline Consortium.      In our comments, we will address virtually all the questions HUD presented in the propos ed rule,  as well as related matters of concern.   Implementation and expansion of the smoke -free rule:   Based on our experience, SFELP now  estimates that well over 700 PHAs have already adopted smoke -free policies for their housing,  including some of the sm allest and some of the largest PHAs in the nation.  Further, we estimate  that thousands of HUD -assisted other affordable multi -unit housing providers have already  adopted smoke -free policies for their housing.  Likewise, thousands of market -rate multi -unit  housing providers have adopted smoke -free policies.  In other words, there is a vast reservoir of  experience in adopting and implementing smoke -free multi -unit housing policies.  There are few  questions about adopting and implementing such policies that h avenÕt already been addressed  and dealt with; best practices are well known.   It should be noted that, to the best of our extensive experience, there has never been a legal  challenge to a smoke -free policy in public housing, other affordable housing or mar ket -rate  housing.  Further, we know of no PHA (or other affordable housing provider) adopting a smoke -free policy and then revoking such policy.  In other words, the policies work; if they didnÕt, they  would be revoked.   We encourage HUD to finalize this r ule with the requirement that all PHAs must adopt a smoke -free policy within 18 months of its effective date, as is set forth in the proposed rule.  In our  experience, 18 months is sufficient time for P HAs to work with PHA resident s, hold public  meetings,  and incorporate the new smoke -free requirements in residentÕs leases.  However , we  !$!also encourage HUD to  require PHAs to begin the impleme ntation process within sixty (60) days  of the effective date of the rule so that the PHAs will have sufficient time to  smoothly implement  the policy with resident involvement and buy -in.   Further, we encourage HUD to maintain in the  final rule  the requirement that PHAs that  have already adopted a smoke -free policy must review  it and amend the policy if it does not conform  to the final HUD rule.  This requirement is  necessary because some PHA smoke -free policies allowed current residents who were smokers  when the policy was adopted to continue to smoke for as long as they live in their current unit.   Further, we strongly en courage HUD to expand the smoke -free rule to include all other HUD -assisted affordable housing providers, and require that they make all units in their HUD -assisted  housing smoke -free.  Currently, HUDÕs proposed rule explicitly states that such housing  providers are not to be covered by this rule, presumably because some of the units in some of  these buildings are not HUD -assisted units.  Yet, the health risks  of secondhand smoke  to the  residents in the HUD -assisted units are no different than  they are to t he residents in PHA units.   Likewise, the dangers of fires caused by cigarettes are no different, nor are the increased  maintenance costs associated with the tar and nicotine on the walls of units with smokers, or the  cigarette caused burns on carpeting an d counters.  We strongly encourage HUD to require all  HUD-assisted housing be covered completely by the smoke -free rule, and that HUD implement  this requirement by including it in all future contracts or agreements with HUD -assisted housing  providers.  Whi le there is the potential that some current HUD -assisted housing providers would  resist such a requirement, we believe, based on our experience in working with many HUD -assisted housing providers, that very, very few would give up their HUD assisted housin g contracts because of this rule.  These providers have these contracts both because they believe in  the value of and need for affordable housing, and because they need the HUD assistance to fill  their buildings.  Just as few PHA residents have moved out b ecause their PHA adopted a smoke -free policy, we are convinced that very few HUD -assisted housing providers would turn their  back on  the HUD assistance.  In fact, ma ny of these providers would like to adopt smoke -free  policies, and a HUD requirement that  they  must do so would be welcomed.   Waterpipes (hookah), e -cigarettes, and marijuana, i ncluding for medicinal purposes:   We should note at the outset that numerous PHAs with smoke -free policies already include  prohibitions on the smoking of e -cigarettes and  related electronic nicotine delivery devices, as  well as hookah, as well as marijuana, including when a resident has been approved by the state to  use it for medicinal purpose s.  In fact, as long ago as 2012 , we included such prohibitions in our  model smo ke-free policy for Michigan PHAs, and we included it because the PHAs requested  that we provide them with language to accomplish this purpose.  This language has also been  used by many HUD -assisted affordable housing providers in Michigan , and many PHAs an d HUD-assisted affordable housing providers in other states .  The following is the language u sed  in our model policy, with Italics added:               Smoking is not permitted anywhere in the building including apartments, in accordance  with the following  schedule.  Effective on [date of adoption of the policy], all current  residents, all employees, all guests and all new residents of [name of building] after this  date will be prohibited from smoking anywhere in the building, including in apartment  units.   Failure of any resident to follow the smoke -free policy will be considered a lease  violation.   This policy applies to the smoking of electronic cigarettes.  It also applies to  !%!the smoking of marijuana for medicinal purposes, even if the resident has approv al from  the state of Michigan to use marijuana for medicinal purposes, since such use violates  federal laws .  PHAs requesting this model language did so for two major reasons:  1) because they recognized  that there was (and still is) no reliable, scientifi c research demonstrating that electronic nicotine  delivery devices and their secondhand aerosol is safe, while there is research demonstrating that  it is not safe for the health of humans; and 2) because many electronic nicotine delivery devices  look very  much like regular tobacco cigarettes, it would greatly complicate their enforcement of  their smoke -free policies .  For these reasons, we strongly encourage HUD to include waterpipes  (hookah), electronic nicotine delivery devices, and marijuana, including f or medicinal purposes,  in the final rule as also prohibited.   An additional provision in the proposed rule should be clarified:  Any Òreasonable  accommodationÓ must not include the ability to smoke indoors.   Some public housing trade  organizations have sug gested that Òreasonable accommodationsÓ must be provided for smokers.   While we do not dispute that  Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and/or  Fair Housing Act  (FHA)  reasonable accommodations requests must be considered, we suggest that HUD make  clear in  the final rule  the following as set forth in the TCLC comments:  The proposed ruleÕs preamble notes that PHAs have the ability to designate outdoor  smoking locations. It then notes that that the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)  gives residents Òthe ri ght to seek a reasonable accommodation, including request s from  residents with mobility -impairment or mental disability.Ó  While this is an accurate  summary of the ADAÕs reasonable accommodation provision, the placement of the  reference immediately followin g a reference to outdoor smoking locations might leave  some with the impression that the ADA requires the accommodation of smokers with  disabilities by allowing them to smoke indoors. This is not the case, as acknowledged in a  HUD fact sheet about the prop osed rule,  and the final rule would be strengthened by  making this point clear.  Courts that have weighed in on this issue have flatly concluded that neither status as a  smoker nor addiction to nicotine constitutes a ÒdisabilityÓ within the meaning of the  ADA. Further, public housing residents  Ð particularly those who have disabilities  themselves  Ð have a right to breathe uncontaminated air, regardless of the disability status  of smokers within the same housing complex.  An example of a reasonable  accommodati on might involve moving a resident with disabilities who smokes to the  ground floor so that she has more convenient access to an outdoor smoking area or  providing her access to free nicotine replacement therapy, but it would not include  allowing her to smo ke indoors. The proposed rule creates no legal burden on people with  disabilities, and the final rule would be strengthened by making this point more clear.   The following are SFELPÕs responses to  the  questions posed in the HUD proposed regulation:   1. What b arriers that PHAs could encounter in implementing smoke -free housing?  What costs could PHAs incur? Are there any specific costs to enforcing such a  !&!policy?  In our extensive experience working with well over 150 PHAs throughout the U.S.  on smoke -free housin g policies, the major barrier to adoption of smoke -free policies is inertia, some of  which is due to other work priorities and also to the PHAs not being certain how to go about  adopting and implementing such policies.  By requiring PHAs to adopt and imple ment smoke -free policies and setting an 18 month timeline for doing so, HUD will eliminate the inertia  barrier.  By HUD providing technical assistance and training to PHAs on this issue, and by local HUD  offices assisting PHAs in obtaining additional techni cal assistance from state and local heal th  departments, PHAs will hav e a clear pathway for the adoption of these policies.  In our experience, PHAs have incurred minimal costs in adopting, implementing and enforcing  smoke -free policies.  The only costs weÕv e seen are a minimal amount of staff time for holding  resident meetings on the topic and minimal time on responding to complaints about violations of  the smoke -free policy .  These staff time costs are overwhelmingly offset by the savings that will  accrue f rom having less maintenance costs associated with rehabbing units when smokers move  out and the units are no longer smoke and tar and nicotine covered and cigarette -related burns  and fires are history.  We have heard this proposed rule referred to by some p ublic housing industry officials as  Òanother unfunded mandate that PHAs must endureÓ.  There is a technical term that can be  applied to such statements:  baloney!  As stated above, the maintenance -related and fire  prevention savings that experience and res earch have shown will accrue to PHAs by having this  smoke -free rule will vastly offset any implementation and enforcement costs.      2. Does this proposed rule adequately address the adverse effects of smoking and  secondhand smoke on PHAs and PHA residents?  The proposed rule will go a long way toward protecting and improving the health and well -being  of PHA residents, and HUD is to be commended for taking this important step.  However, as noted above,  the rule needs to be expanded to cover all HUD -assisted hous ing, not  simply PHAs.  As is obvious, the health dangers to residents of all HUD -assisted housing are the  same, as are the increased maintenance costs associated with smoking in units, as well as the fire  dangers posed by cigarette and other smoking.  If t he dangers and the costs are the same, then the  rules should be the same.  It should be noted that even NAHRO and PHADA in their somewhat  tepid support for the proposed rule in their January 6, 2016 comments  at the White House/HUD  forum, endorsed and calle d for other HUD -assisted housing to be required to follow the same  rule as PHAs.  Also as noted above, other smoking products, such as waterpipes (hookah), electronic nicotine  delivery devices, and marijuana used for any purpose, should explicitly be covere d by the  smoke -free policy in order to protect the health of all residents.  As state laws change over time  with regard to some of these products, HUD needs to assure that its regulations are clear that  such products cannot be smoked in HUD -assisted housin g. !\\'!As noted above, SFELP/TCSG, as a founding member of the national Tobacco Control Legal  Consortium (TCLC), is also a signatory on the detailed and highly footnoted comment of this  proposed rule which TCLC is submitting, along with Americans for Nonsmoker sÕ Rights, the  Association for Nonsmokers  Ð Minnesota, the National African American Tobacco Prevention  Network, and the North American Quitline Consortium.  We herein wholeheartedly endorse the  TCLC comments recommending that HUD replace the proposed defi nition of Òlit tobacco  productsÓ with a broad definition of ÒsmokingÓ which would include these other smoking  products.     While the proposed rule states that smoking outdoors, if allowed at all, must be at least 25 feet  from PHA housing and administrative  buildings, we suggest that HUD explicitly state in the  final rule that all balconies and patios connected to PHA housing are covered by the rule.  If this  is not stated explicitly, there most certainly will be co nfusion and controvers y. 3. Does this proposed  rule create burdens, costs, or confer benefits specific to families,  children, persons with disabilities, owners, or the elderly, particularly if any  individual or family is evicted as a result of this policy?  SFELP/TCSG has for over 20 years been a leadi ng organization in the nation working on  tobacco and the elderly issues.  Research has long -ago confirmed the health risks  of smoking and  secondhand smoke  to old er persons and to persons of all ages with respiratory illne sses,  including COPD and asthma.  B est practices recommended by CDC, EPA and HUD clearly set  forth the health benefits of smoke -free policies in all settings, including the home.  We firmly  believe the proposed rule will confer significant health and safety benefits to all residents,  includ ing those with respiratory illnesses.  In our extensive experience working with hundreds of PHAs and other affordable and market -rate multi -unit housing providers, evictions due to violations of smoke -free policies are rare in  the extreme.  With over a deca de of experience with PHAs and over 700 PHAs with smoke -free  policies, this isnÕt a theoretical question, it  is a fact.  Experience has demonstrated that PHA  residents live in PHA housing for three major reasons: the housing is good; the location is right  for them; and the price canÕt be beat.   Experience has shown that only the most virulent opponent  of a smoke -free policy will risk losing this housing just so that s/he doesnÕt have to go outside to  smoke.  Virtually all PHAs with smoke -free policies treat  the rule in the same manner as any  other rule, which normally means violators get at least three violations before an eviction notice  is given.  And, experience has demonstrated that only a few such evictions happen.   With regard to the Òcosts and benefit s of this proposed ruleÓ as set forth in the proposed rule, we  believe it is seriously flawed in a number of ways.  Rather than make an extensive comment on  the cost/benefit analysis in the proposed rule, we will defer to the comments on this submitted by  expert researchers at the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of  California, San Francisco on January 12, 2016.  4. For those PHAs that have already implemented a smoke -free policy, what  exceptions to the requirements have been  granted based on tenantsÕ requests?  Again, SFELP, having worked with hundreds of PHAs in Michigan and across the nation, found  !(!that some of the PHA early -adopters of smoke -free policies ÒgrandfatheredÓ current residents  who were smokers when the policy was  adopted and allowed them to continue smoking in their  unit either for a short period of time, such as 6 months or a year, or they allowed them to  continue to smoke in their unit for as long as they lived in the unit.  However, experience demonstrated to PH As that such ÒgrandfatheringÓ policies created more  problems than they solved because it made enforcement much more difficult for PHA staff, since  it was difficult to tell who was smoking in which unit.  Plus, nonsmoking residents complained  that the secon dhand smoke health issues remained and would remain for as long as some  residents could smoke.  Today, it is rather rare to see such ÒgrandfatheringÓ policies included in PHA smoke -free  policies, and we have also seen many PHAs revisit such exemptions and r evise their policies to  set a finite date when no smoking  would be allowed in the property.  We strongly encourage HUD to maintain the proposed policy that says all PHA properties must  be totally smoke -free inside as of 18 months after the effective date  of the final rule.  While we  have heard some national public housing trade organizations request local flexibility or Ònot a  one-size fits allÓ policy, on the issue of requiring all PHAs to be totally smoke -free inside within  18 months of the effective dat e of the rule, HUD should stand firm.  5. For those PHAs that have already implemented a smoke -free policy, what  experiences, lessons, or advice would you share based on your experiences with  implementing and enforcing the policy?  Again, SFELP, having worked w ith hundreds of PHAs in Michigan and across the nation, found  that the following were the most important lessons learned:  1) meetings with residents prior to  adopting a smoke -free policy are  essential and should include a discussion of why the policy is  being considered and should allow resident comments and input;  2) respect for resident opinions  must be shown;  3) information on smoking cessation options should be provided, including on  what is available through Medicaid, Medicare and other insurance or q uitlines;  and 4)  enforcement must be consistent, fair and respectful.  6. For those PHAs that have already implemented a smoke -free policy, what tobacco  cessation services were offered to residents to assist with the change? Did you  establish partnerships with  external groups to provide or refer residents to these  services?  Tobacco cessation services will be most successful when coordinated with state quit -lines and  other existing cessation services.  Information should be disseminated to residents about how  Medicare, Medicaid and related programs cover cessation -related benefits.  7. Are there specific areas of support that HUD could provide PHAs that would be  particularly helpful in the implementation of the proposed rule?  In implementing this rule, HUD can be par ticularly helpful in the following ways:   1) train at  least one HUD employee in every HUD office on how best to assist local PHAs on implementing  this rule;  2) sponsor/host at least one statewide training on this rule for PHAs in every state;  and  !)!3) in the se statewide training events, involve PHAs  that have already implemented smoke -free  policies and involve the state tobacco control program since most such programs now have  experience worki ng with PHAs on smoke -free policies . HUD is to be commended for alr eady having created a Òtool kitÓ and other best practice  materials for PHAs and other HUD -assisted housing providers to utilize in adopting,  implementing and enforcing smoke -free policies.  Continuing to update these materials, as  needed, and continuing to  provide smoke -free housing sessions at national housing conferences  will provide additional assistance for  PHAs and other HUD -assisted housing providers.  8. Should the policy extend to electronic nicotine delivery systems, such as e -cigarettes?  Yes, as stated  above.  9. Should the policy extend to waterpipe tobacco smoking? Does such smoking  increase the risk of fire or property damage?  Yes and yes, as stated above.  Conclusion:   SFELP/TCSG is pleased to offer our comments on the proposed HUD rule to  institute smok e-free housing in PHAs and hope s that HUD will expand the coverage of this rule  to other HUD -assisted housing in the final rule.  We, again, commend HUD for this very  significant in itiative to prot ect PHA resident s, staff and visitors  and to improve HUD Ðassisted  housing overall.  We encourage HUD to expeditiously review comments on this proposal and  issue the final regulation within as short a period of time as possible.  Respectfully,  James A. Bergman, J.D.

       " '1      January 19, 2016   Office of General Counsel   Regulations Division  U.S.  Department of Housing and Urban Development  451 Seventh Street S.W., Room 10276  Washington, D.C. 20410 -0500  RE:    Response to Department of Housing and Urban  Development ™s Proposed Rule,  ﬁInstituting Smoke -Free Public Housing,ﬂ 24 CFR Parts 965 and 966, [Docket No. FR  5597-P-02] Comments submitted electronically   The National Center for Healthy Housing (NCHH) and its subsidiary, Healthy Housing  Solutions, Inc.  (Solutions), are pleased to provide commentary on the  proposed  Rule , ﬁInstituting  Smoke -Free Public Housing .ﬂ Both organizations have a longstanding interest in promoting  practical and effective actions to  achieve  smoke -free  multi -unit Housing (MUH).   We wish to thank  the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development  (HUD) for its  significant effort s to reduce exposure of public housing authority  (PHA)  residents to second -hand smoke, improve the health of residents and  staff, and reduce  PHA  costs associated with  smoking -related  repair s and preventable fires.  The benefits of living in a smoke -free  environment are well documented and not disputed.  The challenge is to  obtain the resources to   implement and sustain a smoke -free policy.  Although we recognize that the proposed  Rule  does  not  require that residents quit smoking, we believe that the most sustainable approach to   eliminating smoking  with in the home is to integrate existing efforts and funding streams  currently directed at the health of PHA residents.  Many resources touch the lives of  these  residents , including but not limited to  case managers, school nurses, Affordable Care A ct  insurance exchange navigators, immunization clinics, and home health care providers . Sometimes these experts operate in a silo due to funding streams or  workloads , which can  result  in multiple  individuals  unknowingly  working with  the same resident . Further, some case  managers or other health care providers believe that they are not allowed to work with  PHA  staff   and so may not  bring  in  such  staff as part of the team.  This is a lost opportunity to have a greater  collective impact to benefit residents.  We encourage HUD to incentivize entities that are already   providing  resources or support  to PHA residents  and  to do so in an integrated ﬁwhole person  careﬂ  approach in collaboration with PHA staff.   Background  NCHH  and Solutions  have  provided technical assistance and support to  HUD  through  factsheets   and commentary on the HUD Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes™ ﬁLeading Our   Nation to Healthier Homes: The Healthy Homes Strategic Plan,ﬂ the Federal Healthy Homes  2  Work Group ™s ﬁAdvancing Healthy Housing: A Strategy for Action,ﬂ the  ﬁChange Is in the Airﬂ  smoke -free policies toolkit, and , most recently, as a contributor to the  ﬁDeveloping a Healthy  Homes Research Agendaﬂ Workshop.  In conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC), NCHH  and Solutions  have  led national expert panels to assess strength of the  scientific evidence in support for specific housing interventions.  Also,  in partnership with  the  American Public Health Association (APHA) , NCHH developed the  National Healthy Homes  Standard , a tool f or communities to assess the adequacy of their health and building codes to  create safe and healthy homes against minimum performance standards.     Solutions has pr ovided assistance on how to implement smoke -free  MUH  policies  through  the  training  provided by  the  HUD-funded  National  Healthy Homes Training Center  and Network,  and the  CDC -funded  National Healthy Homes and Lead Poisoning Prevention Training Center , technical assistance documents such as the HUD  Healthy Homes Program Gu idance Manual , and CDC -funded research into the implementation of smoke -free MUH policies in California,  Maine, Minnesota, and Florida. The Los Angeles County component of that  CDC  research   serves as one of the largest quasi -experimental pre - and post -test  research project s of  its kind in  the nation. It focuses on the impact of smoke -free policies on residents™ indoor air quality, and  the associated costs and benefits. Quantitative and qualitative data collected for this project   include resident and  property manager surveys, unit visual assessments, saliva cotinine and   Indoor Air Quality samples, and feedback from focus groups.   NCHH and Solutions support the proposed  HUD  Rule .  We concur with the  Childhood Asthma Leadership Coalition™s  review of  the science that   supports adoption of smoke -free MUH policies. We confine our observations to  the questions  posed in  HUD™s  request for comment.  1. What are the barriers that PHAs could encounter in implementing smoke -free housing?  What costs could PHAs  incur? Are there any specific costs to enforcing such a policy?  The barriers to implementation are significant but surmountable . Discussions with staff  and  residents of  PHA  properties indicate general support for the adoption o f the  Rule , but also the  need for HUD to take a more direct role in providing guidance and resources for implementation.   Those barriers  include :  1.1 Lack of adequate resident engagement is the key barrier to successful smoke -free polices.  We recommend that HUD provide concrete examples of successful resident  involvement  in policy adoption and implementation.    1.2 PHAs  need support in implementing the  Rule . There are numerous examples of  successful  implementation that can be shared with those agencies.  Speci fic examples of  cross agency communication regarding the  proposed  Rule  can be provided to PHAs , such  as improved  communications between housing, health, code enf orcement,  and  legal aid  agencies about the goals of the  Rule , and ways agencies c an work together to support and  enforce it.  1.3 Signage is one cost that could be reduced by providing free, consistent, quality  sign s distributed by a central office.  1.4 Lack of consistent and accurate information  regarding  the availability of  smoking   cessation programs in the region or state along with accurate information regarding   insurance coverage for these programs  is  also  a barrier . HUD or its partner agencies can  play an important role by providing this information to PHAs  from  one centralized entity.    3   2. Does this proposed rule adequately address the adverse effects of smoking and  secondhand smoke on PHAs and PHA residents?    2.1 Waterpipes, which are not addressed in the  Rule , do increase the risk of fires.  2.2 Smokeless tobacco chews do not pose a secondhand smoke risk, but  still  adversely   affect  residents™ health.   2.3 With regard to adverse effects on PHAs ™ operations , there needs to be careful  documentation and research going forward  that  measur es the costs and benefits of  smoke free policies on the agencies and residents.      3. Are there specific areas of support that HUD could provide PHAs that w ould be  particularly helpful in the implementation of the proposed rule?    3.1 As stated earlier, we believe that resources exist in most  (but not all)  communities   that could be harnessed to support PHAs in implementation of this  Rule . Those  resources are generally not controlled by HUD.  Often the originating source s of the  funds are through the Agency of Health and Human Services or  CDC . HUD can be  extremely helpful in dismantling the historic divide between  health care, social   service , and housing agencies by sending the message to other federal  partners  that  such  agencies can and should work closely with their local  PHAs  to implement this  proposed  Rule  together.   In conclusion,  NCHH  and  Solutions  jointly  support HUD™s proposed  Rule . We do not think the  Rule  should be voluntary . Experience has shown that 18 months is generally an adequate amount  of time to implement  a smoke -free MUH  policy if there is sufficient resident engagement.  We  would support  expansion  of this  Rule  to all subsidized housing, not just PHA housing, on the  basis that residents should not be subjected to secondhand smoke just because they live in  such  housing.  The right to breathe freely should not be limited to  the  type of housing  in which people  live .     Our key message is that a sustainable policy requires that smoking is not treated in a vacuum . The root causes of smoking and  the  challenges in quitting are connected to a variety of socio -economic and behavioral health fa ctors.  As such, existing resources directed at these issues  should be combined, and likely increased in some cases, to support tobacco cessation as one of   many important health strategies and not as a free standing problem for PHAs to solve alone.

Clean air is fundamental to good health. 2. Exposure to the toxins of first, second and even third hand smoke can cause sinus infections, asthma, various forms of cancer, heart problems, and other health related sickness. 3. These problems are also aggravated in outside areas around the campus. 4. Many residents are already dealing with minor and major health problems without the added burden of smoking related problems. 5. Three people died last year in Michigan alone from oxygen/smoking related accidents. 6. In Michigan Attorney Generals\\' Opinion No. 6719 on May 4, 1992 it was stated \"neither state nor federal law prohibits a privately-owned apartment complex from renting only to non-smokers. 7. Smokers are not a protected legal class, i.e. there is no \"right to smoke\" under any law. It is considered an addiction therefore has no legal protection. 8. The cost of redoing an apartment vacated by a smoker is three times as much as a non-smoker. 9. With all the hospitals in Michigan and the majority of colleges, many factories, restaurants, bars, parks and beaches having tobacco free campuses and areas why should seniors have to suffer. 10. As for the less than 20°/o of the residents that continue to put their and our health at risk we believe they should be given access and assistance to the various cessation programs and a space/structure at the farthest end of the property and be grandfathered in for a year. 11. Why are you waiting 18 months. More people will die. 30 days is enough. 12. We have many more problems than just the smoking being we are \"off the grid\". You should stop in and visit sometime. Our new manager is doing a great job even though she is overwhelmed with work. Many will not sign this due to the intimidation and bullying from the ex manager and the Marysville Housing Commission. From the Marysville Housing Commission meeting of October 15, 2015 It was a very enlightening meeting to say the least. I had wondered why Deem and the rest were so accommodating. When the auditor spoke he sort of opened a can of worms so to speak. He talked about Wayne and how at the beginning he was very on board and the last few years he was very sort of standoffish. As he talked about things he brought up the HUD report that the commission had received recently. He noted that HUD said it had not been doing it\\'s job over the years as far as monitoring MHC and also that MHC had not been doing it\\'s job. Both money wise and the welfare of the residents. Deem noted that they needed to do a better job. I also found out the Joe Johns\\' daughter is married to Janet Haymans\\' son. Janet and her one daughter both live here and both are some of the smokers that harass me and have called in a false report to the police about my driving. Somebody had to organize the eight who came to the meeting and whined about not having a place to smoke if the pavilion was closed to smoking. Joe and Deem had a meeting the night before last months meeting and discussed what to do about the policy (there could have been others). Donna was upset because not one question was asked of her or anyone else about the policy. They just decided to change and water it down. It was after the meeting last month that Deem said to me that I didn\\'t need to go back to that committee I was on and Dr. Mercantant should have retired years ago from the St. Clair County Health Dept. and he would fight the MDCH on the policy until he died. At this one he was almost apologetic. I can\\'t seem to get the minutes of any of the meetings and am just given the agenda for the next meeting. Our so called representative from VH, Julie Boulier has never given an report to the resident association as long as I have lived here. On the Agenda for Public Hearing. I\\'m wondering if Ill-Band E-8 give us an in as to why are they not doing what the majority of residents want such as the new smoking policy being watered down? You can call me anytime for clarification of my scribeling. I\\'m in school Mon. thru Thur. until about one. Why did you take all the work that the manager did to make an up to date smoking policy which spoke to the health and welfare of all the residents and water it down till it was ineffective? Why did you ignore the majority of the residents who want no smoking. Approximately 20 smokers out of over 140 residents, which is less than 1 Oo/o. Why did you ignore the recommendations of the MDCH that the pavillion not be used for smoking in regards to the health of the majority of the residents? Why did you ignore the fact that there is no law state or federal giving smokers \"rights\" as it is deamed to be an addiction, after it was presented to you? Why was a meeting held the night before and by whom to already plan what was to happen at the meeting besides you and Joe Johns.? Does maybe the fact that Joe Johns daughter is married to Janet Hayman (a resident smoker along with her daughter) have something to do with watering down the smoking policy Why did Deem tell me I didn\\'t need to go back to that team I was on? Why did Deam tell me Dr. Mercantant should have retired years ago? (She is the head of the St. Clair County Health Dept.) Why did Deam tell me he would fight the MDCH till the day he died? These are questions I was going to ask at a meeting of the Marysville Housing Commission, but it is just the tip of the ice berg so to speak. There have been many injustices done by these persons and Wayne Pyden to the residents of Vicksburg Halls. Manv are afraid to talk because of the intimidations Marysville Housing Commission c/o Donna Orr August 30, 2015 Kudo\\'s to the commissioners for forward thinking and concerns for the health and well being of the residents of Vicksburg Halls.

The 2006 Surgeon General\\'s report confirms that second hand smoke is hazardous to the health of non-smokers, causing disease and premature death in children and adults who do not smoke. The Public Health Services National Toxicology Program has listed second hand smoke as a known carcinogen, with no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. To insure the quality of air and quality of life to all residents, the Marysville Housing Commission has declared that Smoking is not permitted in any area of any building or on the grounds of any property owned and/or operated by the Marysville Housing Commission, including vehicles, except as stated herein. All tenants, tenant guests, employees, including any representative of, contractor for, or any other person performing work for the Marysville Housing Commission must comply with this updated NO-Smoking Policy. Tenants and tenant guests who fail to comply, will constitute a violation of the lease terms and can result in eviction. Employees, including any representative of, contractor for, or any other person performing work for the Marysville Housing Commission who fail to comply will be handled appropriately on a case by case basis. Vicksburg Halls No-Smoking PoHev 1.

NAQC strongly supports HUD\\'s proposal and stands ready to support the agency\\'s implementation efforts. Research has demonstrated that smoke-free housing has a significant, positive impact on the quality of indoor air, reduces the risk of catastrophic fires and reduces the cost of maintenance of housing units. Although not a goal of the HUD proposal, NAQC hopes that the proposed smoke-free rule also will encourage many residents to quit smoking, thereby improving their health for years to come. As you may know, quitlines are a health service that offers telephone support Š information, counseling, medication and other support Š for people who want to quit using tobacco. Quitlines exist in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam as well as all 10 Canadian provinces. NAQC is a non-profit professional organization that aims to maximize the access, use and effectiveness of quitlines; provide leadership and a unified voice to promote quitlines; and offer a forum to link those interested in quitline operations. NAQC is comprised of nearly 400 quitline professionals at state health departments, quitline service provider organizations, research institutes and national organizations. The Consortium enables professionals from these organizations to advance the quality and availability of quitline services. NAQC has joined with other national tobacco control organizations in submitting comments that address the full set of questions posed by HUD. The purpose of this letter is to submit comments in NAQC\\'s area of expertise -- smoking cessation -- which are relevant to the four specific questions shown below: Ł Does this proposed rule adequately address the adverse effects of smoking and secondhand smoke on public housing authorities (PHAs) and PHA residents? Ł What barriers may PHAs encounter in implementing smoke-free housing? What costs could PHAs incur? Are there any specific costs to enforcing such a policy? Ł For those PHAs that have already implemented a smoke-free policy what tobacco cessation services were offered to residents to assist with the change? Did you establish partnerships with external groups to provide or refer residents to these services? Ł Are there specific areas of support that HUD could provide PHAs that would be particularly helpful in implementation of the proposed rule? / 3219 E. Camelback Road, #416, Phoenix, AZ 85018 Ł Phone: 1-800-398-5489 ° Fax: 1-800-398-5489 www.naquitline.org  50103 Organization Adverse Effects of Smoking on PHA Residents The proposed rule adequately addresses the adverse effects of smoking and secondhand smoke on PHAs and non-smoking PHA residents, but it does not address the effects on residents who use tobacco. In this section, we estimate the number of PHA residents who smoke and describe the harmful effects of their smoking. Approximately 1.2 million adults live in the 700,000 housing units that would be affected by HUD\\'s proposed rule. Although the national U.S. smoking prevalence rate is at 18 percent, very large disparities exist in smoking rates among different racial and ethnic groups and by educational level, socioeconomic status and region of the country. Among adult public housing residents, NAQC believes that the average smoking prevalence rate would be similar to that of Medicaid members, about 33 percent,\\' which is 83 percent higher than the national rate. Based on this prevalence rate, we estimate 400,000 smokers reside in housing units that would be affected by the proposed rule. According to the most recent Surgeon General\\'s report on smoking,2  smokers suffer from poorer general health than nonsmokers, beginning at an early age and extending throughout adult life. Smoking is a powerful cause of ill-health generally, reducing the quality of life of smokers, limiting their participation in the workplace and increasing their costs to the healthcare system. Among the 42 million tobacco users in the U.S., smoking-related illness costs more than $300 billion each year.3  Smoking also is a leading cause of premature death. The age-standardized relative risk, comparing the all-cause death rate in current smokers to that of never smokers, has more than doubled in men and more than tripled in women since 1964. The lives of smokers are cut short by the development of the many diseases caused by smoking (including cancer, respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, eye diseases and complications of diabetes and immune disorders) and by their greater risk of dying from common health events, such as complications of routine surgeries and pneumonia. Smoking shortens life far more than most other risk factors for early mortality; smokers are estimated to lose more than a decade of life due to premature deaths from tobacco-related diseases. For current smokers residing in PHAs, we expect 4 million years of life will be lost due to premature deaths from tobacco-related diseases if no action is taken to change their smoking status. Barriers PHAs May Encounter in Implementing and Enforcing Smoke-Free Housing Rule PHAs have and will encounter barriers in implementing and enforcing smoke-free housing. HUD\\'s proactive approach in identifying and overcoming implementation and enforcement barriers is critically important as its PHAs provide a safety net for housing; evictions resulting from non-compliance with the smoke-free rule would be untenable given the vulnerability of the resident population and the mission of the agency. It will be imperative to do all you can to reduce the likelihood of implementation barriers and non-compliance with the rule. In a recent meeting to discuss HUD\\'s smoke-free initiative, staff from three housing authorities (i.e., Duluth, Boston and Providence) that have adopted smoke-free policies shared their experiences.4  Among these three PHAs, nearly all of the barriers that were encountered while implementing smoke-free initiatives were raised by residents who smoke. Representatives from the Duluth, Boston and Providence housing authorities agreed that thoughtful and well-planned implementation, including the provision of cessation support, is very important for overcoming barriers. 2 As a strategy, NAQC encourages HUD to begin making PHA residents aware of existing cessation resources and encouraging quit attempts as soon as possible. By coordinating with healthcare organizations that serve PHA residents and local cessation treatment providers (such as quitlines), PHAs may begin lowering the smoking rates among residents  before  the rule takes effect, thereby reducing barriers that will be encountered during implementation and enforcement. It is worth noting that the majority of adult smokers are interested in quitting (75%) and make a quit attempt each year (65%).5  By making PHA residents aware of efPective cessation resources, HUD will be facilitating successful quit attempts among its residents. Cessation resources should continue to be made available throughout implementation and enforcement of the smoke-free rule. The Importance of Cessation Resources for a Smoke-Free Rule Although HUD\\'s smoke-free rule is aimed at reducing the health effects of tobacco smoke on non-smokers who live in PHAs along with reducing some economic costs associated with smoking in housing (i.e., fires and maintenance), smoke-free initiatives have the added benefit of motivating smokers to attempt to quit.12  Smoke-free policies have been shown to reduce tobacco use prevalence by 3.4 percent and to increase tobacco cessation by 6.4 percent.6  As HUD takes action on the smoke-free rule, encouraging cessation and ensuring that cessation services are available for residents who smoke will confer a number of benefits: Ł Cessation resources are welcomed information by most smokers. Nearly all smokers (95%) regret their decision to ever start smoking. In a study among smokers in New York City, two-thirds reported wanting to quit, but acknowledged needing help to be successful in staying quit.8  Ł Cessation resources help counter the addictive nature of tobacco products. Several studies have found that people do not fully appreciate the addictive nature of tobacco products.s\\'o  \" Research has demonstrated that tobacco products are addictive and that most smokers are addicted to cigarettes.1213  Addiction keeps smokers smoking. Ł Encouraging cessation and ensuring availability of cessation resources will increase the success of quit attempts above the 6.4 percent that can be expected from a smoke-free initiative. State quitlines have an average quit rate of 31 percent.14  Cessation treatment by healthcare providers is similarly successful. Smoking cessation has an immediate positive effect on health, and the effect grows over time. Smokers who quit smoking by age 40 will reduce the years of life lost (due to premature mortality from smoking-related diseases) by approximately 90%. Even at age 60, quitting can reduce the years of life lost by approximately 40%.12  Among three housing authorities (Duluth, Boston and Providence) that have already adopted smoke-free policies, residents were interested in telephone and in-person counseling as well as FDA-approved cessation medications. NAQC encourages HUD to make available to residents the full scope of cessation treatments included in the U.S. Public Health Services\\' Clinical Practice Guideline.15  These treatment services encompass the range of preferences expressed by smokers residing in the PHAs. 3 Quitlines and Other Cessation Resources that HUD May Provide for PHAs To prevent implementation challenges and to gain the most benefit possible for PHA residents from the smoke-free rule, HUD should make a concerted effort to partner with cessation providers and healthcare organizations to ensure availability of adequate levels of cessation treatment. Cessation resources should be included as part of its pre-implementation, implementation and ongoing enforcement activities. HUD should require communications that encourage cessation and that make residents aware of cessation resources, and HUD should ensure that services are available to its PHA residents. As noted on page two, NAQC estimates that one-third of all residents in public housing (i.e., 400,000 adults) are smokers and will be impacted by HUD\\'s smoke-free initiative. This is a substantial population of smokers. Key cessation resources and possible partners that HUD may want to engage in implementing the smoke-free rule are described in the section below. State Quitlines:  Cessation services are available through state quitlines in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam. The types of services and eligibility criteria vary somewhat by state (see  http:// map.naguitline.org/)  but generally includes information about quitting, support in developing a quit plan, 3-5 counseling sessions and a two week supply of inedication. Quitlines receive about 1.3 million calls each year and provide treatment services to approximately a half-million tobacco users each year. The total annual budget for state quitlines is $125.5 million.14  Although state quitlines are available to support quit attempts by PHA residents, additional funding will likely be needed by the states to adequately support the level of treatment services needed by the 400,000 PHA residents who smoke. Primary budget sources for state quitlines include state appropriations and MSA funds (about 80%), as well as supplemental funding from CDC\\'s Office on Smoking and Health (about 20%). NAQC and CDC are available to provide additional information about state quitlines and to facilitate partnerships between the PHAs and state quitlines. Contracts with Quitline Service Providers:  Many health plans and self-insured businesses contract directly with quitline service providers. If HUD would like to offer a uniform type of cessation service to all residents who currently smoke in PHAs, with a dedicated telephone number and reports on utilization and quit rates, it may choose to contract directly with a quitline service provider. NAQC highly recommends the service providers who operate state quitlines. A list of quitline service providers is available from NAQC, and NAQC is available to facilitate partnerships between HUD and quitline service providers. Other Cessation Resources:  Many residents of PHAs are likely to receive healthcare services through state Medicaid programs and community health centers, including Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). These healthcare services are overseen at the federal level by CMS (Medicaid) and HRSA (FQHCs) within US DHHS, and may play an important role in providing in-person treatment services to smokers in PHAs. The US DHHS and CDC may be available to facilitate HUD partnerships with Medicaid programs and FQHCs. Conclusion The proposed rule to institute smoke-free public housing heralds an exciting new era for building a culture of safety and improved health for residents of public housing. NAQC is confident that the recommendations included in this letter are consistent with HUD\\'s mission and if adopted would help reduce barriers that may be encountered during implementation and enforcement of Ll the smoke-free rule. NAQC and its network of inembers across the U.S. stand ready to help HUD in its efforts. Our key messages and recommendations are: Ł NAQC estimates that one-third of all PHA residents (i.e., 400,000 adults) are smokers. If no action is taken, their continued smoking is likely to result in poorer general health than non-smoking PHA residents, development of tobacco-related diseases, considerable healthcare and other costs, and the loss of 4 million years of life due to premature deaths from tobacco-related diseases. NAQC recommends that housing authorities coordinate with healthcare organizations that serve PHA residents and local cessation treatment providers (such as quitlines) as soon as possible to make residents aware of available smoking cessation resources and encourage them to quit. By beginning to lower the smoking prevalence among PHA residents before the smoke-free rule takes effect, fewer barriers will be encountered during implementation and enforcement. In addition, by making PHA residents aware of effective cessation resources, HUD will be facilitating successful quit attempts among its residents. Cessation resources should continue to be made available throughout implementation and enforcement of the smoke-free rule. Ł To maximize the impact of the smoke-free rule on successful quit attempts, NAQC recommends that HUD make effective smoking cessation treatments, as described in the U.S. Clinical Practice Guideline, available to PHA residents. These treatments encompass the range of treatment preferences expressed by smokers residing in the PHAs (i.e., quitlines, in-person counseling and FDA-approved cessation medications). To prevent implementation challenges and to gain the most benefit possible for PHA residents from the smoke-free rule, NAQC recommends HUD make a concerted effort to partner with cessation providers and healthcare organizations to ensure the availability of adequate levels of cessation treatment. HUD may want to pursue partnerships with state quitlines, quitline service providers, and healthcare organizations that are affiliated with state Medicaid programs and Federally Qualified Health Centers.

Kownack, Hxewtil\\'c 8 Commissioners Barbara Hamm Lee, Cltair Donald Musacchio, Vice Cilair Alphonso Albert Rose Arrington Michael Burnette Richard Gresham Robert Soble Comments of Norfolk Redevelopment and Housing Authority (NRHA) on FR 5597-P-02 Instituting Smoke-Free Public Housing NRHA believes that alternatives exist that more appropriately balance the goals of creating healthier living environments with the added administrative burdens of enforcing a new policy and potential negative unintended consequences for residents, particularly the elderly and persons with disabilities. Difficult to Enforce As stated in a November 15, 2015 Baltimore Sun editorial, \"public housing agencies are not exactly awash in staff ready to enforce such a rule, they are struggling enough to keep up with basic operations and maintenance, much less to seek out smoking scofflaws.\" The proposed rule briefly discusses enforcement issues but does not satisfactorily provide a strategy for identifying rule violations and does not address resident efforts to hide a rule violation. Presumably violations would be reported by other residents and maintenance staff. Resident reticence to report violations, as well as abuse through false reporting, decrease trust between residents, staff and management. Eviction Disproportionately Punitive Smoking is legal in the U.S. Eviction from public housing to an otherwise qualified citizen is the most severe resident action an Authority can take, and is typically reserved for the most egregious offenses. Courts have not looked favorably on broad public housing bans that deny legal activity. Like any landlord HUD can write its smoking policy into the lease, but unlike other renters, public housing tenants often have little choice about where to live. A policy meant to protect health and safety of tenants should not be carried out in a way that achieves the opposite effect by forcing homelessness. P.O. Box 968 I Norfolk, Virginia I 23501-0968 I p 757.623.1111 I tdd. 800.545.1833 8 WWW.NRHA.US Regulations Division, Office of General Counsel January 19, 2016 Page 2 Implementation Costs Are High and Underestimated The proposed rule does a brief cost benefit analysis, but admits a full accounting of costs is not possible. While HUD agrees to foot some nominal training costs, it leaves it to housing authorities to establish and carry out policies, procedures and enforcement methods. There is also no accounting for enforcement and collateral costs to the Authority. This comes with the looming possibility that failure to comply may result in loss of HUD funding. Rewards are Absent The proposed rule insufficiently rewards resident compliance for what is a difficult lifestyle change. Essentially the tenant i s punished by denying housing if they don\\'t quit tobacco. Effective behavioral change happens w hen rewards are present and those are lacking in HUD\\'s approach. More Effective Techniques The proposed rule fails to adequately address and consider other alternatives that NRHA strongly believes would be more effective in reducing resident smoking by: Ł Prohibit smoking in shared/common areas such as property management offices Ł Create smoking and non-smoking units Ł Reward non-smoking via a rent discount or other financial reward Ł Promote an overall health initiative that includes smoking cessation and rewards for health lifestyles Community Partnerships NRHA has partnered with Eastern Virginia Medical on smoking cessation initiatives in our communities: Ł American Academy of Pediatrics Grant on Tobacco Cessation in NRHA Communities Ł Provide public housing residents with educational training and resources on tobacco reduction, which takes place in their communities allowing easier access to services and opportunity to receive peer support.

NRHA recommends the Department more thoroughly study the challenges posed by a blanket smoking ban and to consider alternatives. Discretion to adopt smoke-free policies should remain at the local level. We also encourage the evaluation of the experiences of those housing authorities that have pursued non-smoking initiatives and the development of a more flexible proposal that reflects its findings.

Harbison Executive Director Regulations Division December 29, 2015 Office of General Counsel, Room 10276 Department of Housing and Urban Development 451 7th Street SW Washington, DC 20410-0500 (submitted via www.regulations.gov) Dear Regulations Division: Subject: FR 5597-P-02 Instituting Smoke-Free Public Housing Mailing Address: P. 0. Box 846 Nashville, TN 37202 As a large public housing authority approximately 5,500 public housing units) which has successfully implemented smoke-free policies in our properties for the elderly and disabled (most high-rise buildings), we are pleased to submit our comments in the proposed rule to institute smoke-free policies throughout all public housing. While we commend the intent of the proposed rule (better health for residents, particularly children, reduced maintenance costs, reduced fire risk, etc.), we do not feel that an across-the-board policy for all properties for all PHAs is in the public interest. We feel that there are far too many additional costs that would be imposed on PHAs in preparing for and implementing such a policy; further, it would be arguably a further discriminatory imposition on residents of public housing (such as the current community service requirement) that is not imposed on residents of other HUD-assisted housing programs. In lieu of proceeding with this unfunded mandate, we would recommend that HUD make available financial incentives to offset the implementation costs for those PHAs who feel that they are ready and willing to establish new smoke-free policies in their properties In response to the specific questions on which HUD invited comment, we provide the following: 1. What barriers that PHAs could encounter in implementing smoke free housing? What cost could PHAs incur? Are there any specific costs to enforcing such a policy? Ł Barriers would include insufficient staffing, providing reasonable accommodations for elderly/disabled smokers, funds to support smoking cessation programs, funds to build outdoor smoking areas and the perception that the housing authority is encroaching on the resident\\'s rights. Lastly, we do not believe it is practically feasible to enforce this rule properly in a large family property. Without literally going into every unit every week, how would staff know if a person is frequently smoking? What if we suspect that a person is smoking, but can never catch them in the act? Do we proceed with adverse action based on assumptions? It just seems much more difficult to enforce on large family sites compared to high rise buildings where every unit is contained in one building. Ł Costs would include: salary for more social service coordinators, the expenses for the smoking cessation programs, the cost to build the outdoor smoking areas, usage of staff time to deal with smoking related issues like sending out notices or issuing eviction notices, and the cost of turning more units due to smoking related evictions. We are concerned whether having hundreds of cigarette butts flushed down the toilets daily would have any adverse impact on the plumbing. Since residents know that catching them in the act or seeing cigarette butts in the apartment will be the only way to prove smoking is occurring, this will most likely lead to flushing the evidence. Ł Specific cost are again: staff salary, smoking cessation programs, building of smoking areas, increased paper and printing cost, and the potential for an increase in evictions leading to increased cost to turn units. In the past, we were able to convince partners to commit to teaching the classes for a year during the non-smoking campaign in the high rises. However, it became cumbersome for partners particularly during the days when no residents showed up for the classes, and when we realized the classes needed to continue for several months beyond the effective date. Funds would definitely be needed if this rule goes into effect. We don\\'t believe we\\'d be able to secure the prior level of partner commitments to cover so many weekly  classes simultaneously. 2. Does the proposed rule adequately address the adverse effects of smoking and second hand smoke on PHAs and PHA residents? Ł Yes 3. Does this proposed rule create burdens, costs, or confer benefits specific to families, children, persons with disabilities, owners, or the elderly, particularly if any individual or family is evicted as a result of this policy? Ł There is the potential for this rule to create burdens and costs to individuals in public housing, especially if they are evicted as a result of the policy. Smoking is a serious addiction, one that most people never beat. Implementing this rule and attaching it to a person\\'s housing will create mental distress, physical distress and potentially homelessness. This seems to go against our overall mission of eliminating homelessness and seems like an overreaching policy into a person\\'s personal choice of smoking or not smoking in their private dwelling. In addition, HUD proposes that 18 months is ample time to implement non-smoking system wide. Eighteen months may not be ample time to roll out a smoke-free policy for a PHA with a significant inventory of units, particularly if we plan to implement using the wrap-around services model such as we have developed. Given our past experiences, a around services model is definitely what\\'s needed. Considering our available staff, 18 months is not a lot of time to complete the following: o identify locations for and build the exterior smoking areas at each property, o have town hall style meeting at all the properties, o secure instructors for all of the weekly classes, o mobilize all the needed partners, o organize mass distributions of literature at all of the properties, o plan and host all of the kick-off events, o prepare and hang all the signage, o modify all the leases and prepare protocols for the family properties. We believe implementing and enforcing a smoke-free policy at the family properties will be considerably more difficult than it had been in our high rises. Also, if residents are required to smoke 25 feet from the buildings, PHAs will also need to consider employees who smoke. Being consistent is important. .. or will PHAs require employees to smoke in their cars? The 25-foot rule would also be difficult to implement in family properties located on smaller parcels or located close to adjacent streets: if there is not a 25-foot clearance in a front yard, would be expect residents to smoke out in the street? 4. For those PHAs that have already implemented a smoke free policy, what exceptions to the requirements have been granted based on tenants request? Ł We are not familiar with any such exceptions. 5. For those PHAs that have already implemented a smoke free policy, what experiences, lessons, or advice would you share based on your experiences with implementing and enforcing the policy? Ł The most valuable advice we can share is to offer weekly smoking cessation classes on-site and free of charge. Providing wrap-around services is also crucial. Addiction is a powerful disorder. When it\\'s threatened, emotions can be difficult to manage. It\\'s important to form partnerships with mental health service providers in advance. So that, when you call them, they come quickly. It\\'s equally important to work with those partners throughout implementation. It\\'s also advisable to implement the smoke-free policy in phases and not at all properties simultaneously. Going forward, it will be extremely difficult to benefit from lessons learned (at each property) if HUD requires implementation to occur agency-wide simultaneously. Ł MDHA also had many strategic planning meetings leading up to and throughout the non-smoking campaign. The meetings included property management, social services, maintenance and administration. 6. For those PHAs that have already implemented a smoke free policy, what tobacco cessation services were offered to residents to assist with changes? Did you establish partnerships with external groups to provide or refer residents to these services? Ł Smoking cessation classes were offered once a week at each of the properties targeted for the no-smoking policy. Classes began a full year prior to the effective date of the policy and continued at least six months past the policy\\'s effective date at each of the affected properties. Ł Prior to the onset of classes, a Rally/Services Fair with a non-smoking theme was held at each of the targeted properties. Each Rally also served as an enrolment event for the smoking cessation classes. MDHA developed a newsletter entitled \"Up In Smoke\". The newsletter celebrated the milestones of residents by sharing their testimonials regarding successes as they quit smoking or reduced the number of cigarettes smoked per day. The newsletter illustrated the health risks of smoking and the dangers of secondhand smoke to loved ones. The newsletter included a table showing the hundreds/thousands of dollars spent on the habit over a period of weeks, months and years. Each issue also included reminders about the cessation classes and the social services available to support those struggling with this addiction and related emotional stress. 7. Are there specific areas of support that HUD could provide PHAs that would be particularly helpful in the implementation of the proposed rule? Ł HUD could provide additional funds to help support additional staff needed to make this rule effective. Also, HUD could give PHAs the flexibility to \"phase in\" properties and not require the onset of the smoke-free policy to be agency-wide initially. 8. Should policy extend to electronic nicotine delivery systems, such as cigarettes? Ł Yes, in order for this policy to be truly effective, e-cigarettes should be included. This will help avoid situations where a resident could potentially face adverse action for violating the no smoking rule when they are actually smoking an e-cigarette. It would also eliminate the need for staff to have to make the distinction of whether a person is smoking a real cigarette or an electronic one. Also, in the rule, HUD states that one of the benefits of this rule is the impact on health. E-cigarettes effects have not been studied in enough detail to make the determination of whether they are safer than tobacco or not. The e-cigarettes do still have the very addictive nicotine in them, which  could lead to smoking tobacco cigarettes if the expenses are not similar. 9. Should the policy extend to water pipe tobacco smoking? Does such smoking increase the risk of fire or property damage? Ł Yes, water pipe tobacco smoking is still smoking. The only difference is that the person is smoking out of a water pipe or bong. The same risk of fires, property damage, and health concerns are all still valid. The prohibition should also include smokeless tobacco products under the items prohibited at the properties. We appreciate the opportunity to comment on this proposed regulation. Sincerely, James E. Harbison Executive Director ',\n",
       " '  January 15, 2016  Regulations Division    Office of General Counsel    Department of Housing and Urban Development  451 7th Street SW., Room 10276  Washington, DC 20410-0500   Re: Comments on the proposed Smoke-Free Public Housing          Docket No. FR 5597-P-02 RIN 2577-AC97    As major academic medical center serving the Medical  University of South Carolina is dedicated to  supporting the health and well-being  of our citizens and the patients we serve.  Thus, we commend The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)  for their leadership to advance the health and safety of those living in public housing by proposin g a rule to implement a smoke-free policy for public  housing indoor areas (Docket No. 5597-P-02).  The publi cation of the proposed rule represents a major  step forward in protecting the millions of American s who currently live in federally-owned public  housing from the harms of tobacco.  We urge HUD to adopt a final rule implementing this measure as  soon as possible. Below are our comments and suggestions about the proposed rule.    First and foremost the smoke-free policy for Public  Housing Agency (PHA) is long overdue given the  well documented knowledge on the hazardous impact of secondhand smoke on tenants who do not  smoke, children who are exposed on a regular basis, cost to management for repairs of  building/apartments and the high liability cost of fir es. Although the rule is not as broad reaching as we would like it to be, it is a major step forward. Wh ile many PHAs have already successfully implemented  smoke-free policies, many have not, leaving millions  of residents unprotected from secondhand smoke in  their homes.   Thus, we urge HUD to adopt and implement a final rule as soon as possible.    One concern we had with the proposed rule was length of the process to get the smoke-free-policy  implemented (see page 3 Summary of Major Provisions  of the Proposed Rule).  The approval may not  happen immediately and then there is the 18 mont h implementation timeframe potentially adding another  two years before the policy goes in to effect. This  is too long.  A suggestion to mitigate the wait by  encouraging PHA™s to implement the policy for new re nters and have the lease reflect the new regulations  instead of waiting for the new policy to be enacted.       Another concern was some of the cost estimates (see Pa ge 5 graph under C. Costs and Benefits of this Proposed Rule) for the proposed regulations.  Frankly,  the cost of not implementing this rule would be a  tragedy.   Smoke-free policies for the most part are  very easily enforced and can be accomplished at low  cost and more than offset by savings from lower maint enance and reduced fire risk to buildings.  As noted in the proposed regulation many household residents w ho smoke already restrict their smoking to outside  the home.  Thus, a nonsmoking policy should not be difficult or hard to implement. The suggested   recurring cost of smoker inconvenience (estimated at  $209 million) is bogus and should not be considered  in the calculation of this policy.  The cigarette co mpanies own internal documents acknowledge that most  of their customers would quit if they could. Peopl e continue to smoke because they are addicted to  nicotine and because the cigarette companies have manufact ured a product that is hard to stop using.  The  fact that smokers can™t stop smoking easily is really  the only inconvenien ce that really exists, not a policy  that reinforces not smoking, which would be a  benefit, not an inconvenience to smokers.    A further concern is that not all public housing will not covered by  these regulations. Those living in subsidized housing of any kind of  public housing do not have many opt ions for housing and should not be  forced to put their health and safety  at risk merely to allow others to have the opportunity to smoke inside.   Although they are financed by various sources,  a strong recommendation from HUD should go a long  way in convincing other federally fu nded housing projects  (see Page  12, last paragraph under section C.  Moving to Smoke-Free Public Housing Units) to adhere  to the same regulations.  It is difficult to think that millions of renters will be potentially exposed  to SHS in their homes.  Also, the success of other  PHAs to voluntarily implement smoke-free housing also  shows that this will be a policy can work and  will be accepted by residents.     Our experience in Charleston has shown that a maj ority of people renting housing support smoke free  policies and have no qualms about going outdoor to sm oke. We surveyed rental agencies as well and most  apartment complexes that have not instituted smoke  free policies and found most were supportive of the  idea of adopting a smoke-free doing so, but were wo rried whether implementi ng a smoke-free policy was  legal.  The Executive Director of Charleston Housing Au thority stated that they did a trial run of having  smoke-free apartments that were built in a few years a go. To date they have not  had any complaints or  pushback from the renters and by their account the ex periment has been very successful. That said, the  agency reported it had no plans to extend the  smoke-free policy to other housing units under their  jurisdiction since it was not viewed as a priority.  This  example further solidifies  the need for the issuance of the regulations at the federal level to be complied w ith at the local level for all renters to be protected.   Finally, the final policy should include all combustib le tobacco products including cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and hookah.  There is little evidence that electronic cigarettes pose a health hazard due to  secondhand exposure to vapor, so the inclusion of e-cigare ttes in the policy is difficult to justify at this  time.       We feel that PHA ought to allow residents to have  input on deciding on whether to have a designated  outside smoking area.  However, HUD should provide  guidance on what distances are safe to reduce the  possibility of smoke filtering into any apartments.   We would also support allowing states receiving funds  from other federal agencies (e.g., CDC) to use a por tion of those funds to assist PHA in implementation  of local PHA smoke-free policies, including allocating  funds to support the delivery of tobacco cessation  support to residents.

       " 'A PHILADELPHIA HOUSING AUTHORITY OPENING DOORS TO OPPORTUNITIES 12 SOUTH 23R0 STREET PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 215.684.4174 PHA.PHILA.GOV Regulations Division Office of General Counsel January 6, 2016 Department of Housing and Urban Development 451 7th Street SW., Room 10276 Washington, DC 20410-0500 KELVIN A. JEREMIAH President & Chef Execut1ve Officer Re: Comments on BUD\\'s Proposed Rule Instituting Smoke-Free Public Housing To Whom It May Concern: The Philadelphia Housing Authority (\"PHA\"), in collaboration with resident leadership, and the City of Philadelphia, is pleased to be among the more than 500 housing authorities to institute smoke-free public housing. We therefore commend Secretary Julian Castro and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") for taking bold action to protect the health and safety of public housing residents. PHA is pleased to provide the following comments on the Proposed Rule Instituting Smoke-Free Public Housing released by HUD, and responses to the questions posed in the rule. PHA\\'s Comments 1. A minimum of20\\' rather than 25\\' is sufficient. HUD is proposing a 25\\' restriction from PHA property for smoking. However, to be consistent with the City of Philadelphia\\'s rules regarding smoking outside of public places, PHA instituted a 20\\' perimeter and has expended a great deal of money to create and post signage with that restriction. As one of the largest housing authorities, as well as one of the largest (if not the largest) that has already enacted a Smoke-Free Policy, we urge HUD to consider having a minimum of20\\', not 25\\' in the final rule. 2. Reasonable accommodation is not required for any residents to be able to smoke in HA units or in the restricted areas. While HUD  has indicated that it plans to create guidance for reasonable accommodation for certain categories of public housing resident smokers, this is not necessary, under the definitions for conditions that require such accommodation and the fact that smokers are not a protected class. A reasonable accommodation is appropriate to ensure that persons with disabilities \"have an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling, including public and common use PHA \\'s Comments on HUD \\'s Proposed Rule Instituting Smoke-Free  Public Housing Page 2 of5 spaces,\" (emphasis  added) and sometimes \"treating persons with disabilities exactly the same as others will sometimes deny them an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.\" See, Joint Statement of HUD and the Dep\\'t of Justice, Reasonable Accommodations under the Fair Housing Act: jhc.com/LawsAndPolicies.htmApplicable Laws & Policies. Disallowing mobility-impaired or mentally disabled residents, by not granting them a reasonable accommodation waiver or some sort, from being able to smoke on the public housing premises would not deprive them of an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling-to the contrary, allowing them to do so would deprive the residents who do not smoke in the building of their use and enjoyment of it, due to second-hand smoke and safety concerns. Further the fire risks to such persons are greater than to the impaired, as persons with mobility or mental limitations may be less able to flee in case of a fire or smoke caused by smoking. Smoking is not a protected activity; it is one that is linked to increased likelihood of death and one that has clear negative consequences for those in the vicinity of the smokers as well as the smokers themselves. It has repeatedly been noted, in state and federal courts, that the act of smoking is not a protected activity under the U.S. Constitution, an addiction to tobacco, nicotine or smoking is not considered to be a disability under the Fair Housing Act or the Americans with Disabilities Act, and even if a policy places particular burdens on smokers, individually or as a group (which a prohibition on smoking on the premises would do), the policy does not in and of itself violate the Equal Protection Clause. See, e.g., (NYC Clash Inc. v. New York, 315 F. Supp.2d 461 (S.D.N.Y. 2004); Kurtz v. City of North Miami, 653 So.2d 1025 (Fla.1995); and Fagan v. Axelrod, 550 N.Y.S.2d 552, 559 (1990). 3. HUD should consider working with National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to provide cessation resources in furtherance of the no smoking policy. PHA urges HUD to consider collaboration  with the NIH, which has funded extensive studies on the challenges with quitting smoking, and DHHS Centers for Medicaid and Medicare, which provide health coverage for a significant percentage of public housing residents, to provide cessation resources to public housing residents. 4. Provide resources to housing authorities to cover the cost of evictions for violations of the smoking-ban as stated in the proposed rule. HUD has indicated in the Proposed Rule that housing authorities should incorporate Smoke-Free provisions in its Tenant Lease and use the existing enforcement mechanisms. The ensuing evictions for violation of the proposed provisions will result in additional administrative costs. Will HUD provide financial support to cover the burden of expenses on PHAs, which are reasonably foreseeable, for the additional administrative cost resulting from evictions under the Proposed Rule? PHA \\'s Comments on HUD\\'s Proposed Rule Instituting Smoke-Free Public Housing Page3 of5 5. HUD support for lease enforcement action under the Proposed Rule. Will HUD be supportive of lease enforcement action that is up to and including eviction for tenant violations of the Proposed Rule? PHA\\'s Responses to HUD\\'s Questions While HUD welcomes comments on all aspects of this proposed rule, HUD is seeking specific comment on the following questions 1: 1. What are barriers that HAs could encounter in implementing smoke-free housing? The most significant barrier that the PHA has encountered with enacting the Free Policy was resident resistance to the inclusion of eviction as a consequence, even after a 4-step process and the possibility of expunging one of the violations, for repeated violations of the po.licy. a. What costs could PHAs incur? The PHA incurred considerable administrative costs throughout the two-year process of resident meetings leading up to the adoption of the policy, the creation of a Free Taskforce, and the cost of printing notices to each affected tenant and establishing designated smoking areas. All totaled, PHA invested nearly $300,000 in the creation and implementation of the smoking-ban policy. Further, PHA committed $100,000 to assisting residents with cessation efforts, through working with partners. b. Are there any specific costs to enforcing such a policy? Yes. The PHA incurred administrative cost of sign installation and site preparation of designated smoking areas, and the combined cost of printing, issuing, collecting, and tracking violations to the policy. 2. Does this proposed rule adequately address the adverse effects of smoking and secondhand smoke on HAs and HA residents? Generally, yes. PHA recommends expanding the definition of \"lit tobacco products\" to include electronic cigarettes, since a sufficient number of studies have shown the vapor released by e-cigarettes carries  the similar harmful elements as traditional cigarettes. In addition, as explained in #2, in the Comments section, above, it is not suggested that a reasonable accommodation be created to allow certain persons to smoke in the restricted areas. 1 The term \"HA\" is used for a public housing authority and \"PHA\" is used for the Philadelphia Housing Authority. PHA \\'s Comments on HUD\\'s Proposed Rule Instituting Smoke-Free Public Housing Page4 of5 3. Does this proposed rule create burdens, costs, or confer benefits specific to families, children, persons with disabilities, owners, or the elderly, particularly if any individual or family is evicted as a result of this policy? Yes. The Proposed Rule contains a recommendation for implementing the smoking-ban by including the prohibition in the Tenant Lease and use of enforcement mechanisms, such as lease termination, that are already in place.2 Eviction, as well as participating in the grievance process, is generally burdensome and costly for families, but that has to be weighed with the health and other benefits to the remaining families, as well as those who may enter public housing after those who break their leases are evicted. 4. For those HAs that have already implemented a smoke-free policy, what exceptions to the requirements have been granted based on tenants\\' requests? After years of discussion with residents, the Smoke-Free Policy that was finally adopted by the PHA contained a major exception-in that it does not currently result in eviction for residents in existing units (as defined in the Policy), as it is based on a trial period for evaluation and possibly changing the policy. Residents signing leases for \"new\" units, as defined in the Policy, after August 5, 2015, could face eviction after a 4-step process. 5. For those HAs that have already implemented a smoke-free policy, what experiences, lessons, or advice would you share based on your experiences with implementing and enforcing the policy? The PHA recommends extensive and on-going engagement with residents on the development and implementation of the policy specifically, the creation of a Smoke-Free Taskforce that includes resident leaders and authority executives. The best form of policy enforcement is peer-to-peer discouragement of smoking. 6. For those HAs that have already implemented a smoke-free policy, what tobacco cessation services were offered to residents to assist with the change? Through formal partnerships with the American Heart Association and American Lung Association, as well the 1-800-QuitNow hotline funded by the City of Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Department of Public Health and the National Nursing Centers Consortium, PHA made cessation services and programs widely available and accessible to residents who chose to quit smoking. a. Did you establish partnerships with external groups to provide or refer residents to these services? Yes. See above. 2 See, pg. 18 Lease Provisions. PHA \\'s Comments on HUD \\'s Proposed Rule Instituting Smoke-Free Public Housing Page 5 of5 7. Are there specific areas of support that HUD could provide HAs that would be particularly helpful in the implementation of the proposed rule? PHA recommends that HUD provide small grant funds tethered to fund-leveraging requirements to invest the provision of onsite cessation services and programs. In addition, HUD should provide HAs a sample policy from authority executives and resident leaders that could be used as a baseline for developing an authority specific policy. 8. Should the policy extend to electronic nicotine delivery systems, such as e-cigarettes? Yes. The vapor released by e-cigarettes contains harmful carcinogens. Source: A study funded by the National Institute of Health in 2014, conducted by the scientist from Boston University, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and the University of California at Los Angeles. 9. Should the policy extend to waterpipe tobacco smoking? Yes. PHA would argue the term \"lit tobacco\" includes waterpipe tobacco smoking, known colloquially as \"Hookahs.\" An explicit inclusion of Hookahs in the definition of lit tobacco is recommended. a. Does such smoking increase the risk of fire or property damage? Yes. Waterpipe tobacco, if left unattended, can ignite fires if it comes in contact with carpet fibers or papers. In addition, if remnants of the pipe spill in the unit, the remnants could damage floors or carpets. On behalf of the Philadelphia Housing Authority, thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important regulation. Kelvin A. Jer iah President & CEO Philadelphia Housing Authority ',\n",

Matt Gerard Minneapolis, MN The National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) is an organization whose members Deidre \"DeeDee\" Gilmore Charlottesville, VA include state and local housing coalitions, residents of public and assisted housing, LiSa Hasegawa nonprofit housing providers, homeless service providers, fair housing organizations, Washington, DC researchers, faith-based organizations, public housing agencies, private developers and Isabelle Headrick ro e owners, local and state overnment a encies, and concerned citizens.

Baton Rouge, LA Ann o\\'Hara Resident Engagement and PHA Plan Boston, MA If smoke-free public housing is to be required of every public housing authority (PHA), Robert Palmer Chicago, IL t,vhich NLIHC su orts, en a ement of residents is critical to its success. NLIHC believes PP g g Gre Payne Porttiand, ME that each PHA\\'s smoke-free policy, including its enforcement, monitoring, and smoking cessation activities, must be treated as a significant amendment to the PHA Plan. By Edc Price  inclusion in the PHA Plan, residents will have an opportunity to participate in the Washington, DC Tara Rollins decision-making about the PHA\\'s smoke-free policies and planned cessation activities, Salt Lake City, UT the PHA would have to consult with the Resident Advisory Board about the policy, and Michael Steele there would be a 45 day comment period for tenants and the general public regarding New York, NY the policy.

Dolbeare Dedicated solely to achieving socially just public policy that assures people with the lowest incomes In the Un ited States have affordable and decent homes 1000 Vermont Avenue, NW, Suite 500, Washington, D.C. 20005 1 tel: 202.662.1530 1 fax: 202.393.1973 1 info@nlihc.org  I www.nlihc.org  Page 2 Monitoring NLIHC has heard significant concern from many of our members, including residents of public housing, about how PHAs will monitor compliance with smoke-free policies. The proposed rule is silent on this aspect of the new policy. NLIHC encourages HUD to adopt a national monitoring protocol that is minimally intrusive of residents\\' homes and in no way relies on residents reporting on the smoking habits of their neighbors. For example, a national policy regarding a standard monitoring protocol could include an observational opportunity during a home\\'s annual inspection, for example. A national monitoring protocol will decrease local implementation costs. Enforcement Enforcement of the smoke-free public housing policy is a serious concern. While we recognize that any effective enforcement must be tied to resident leases, eviction of poor families from their home also constitutes a public health emergency. We recommend HUD develop an enforcement policy for PHAs that focuses on education and smoking cessation and avoids eviction. Our nation has made significant investments to try to end homelessness. Any new HUD policy should not frustrate these efforts by evicting extremely low income families from their homes at a time when there is a severe shortage of other housing affordable to them. NLIHC urges HUD to require PHAs to adopt a graduated enforcement of any smoke-free policy that annually resets before any lease termination is initiated. This is similar to the manner undertaken by current smoke-free PHAs. A first violation results in a verbal warning and cessation materials; a second violation results in a verbal warning, cessation materials, referral to a resident services coordinator; a third violation results in a verbal warning, cessation materials, referral to a resident services coordinator; a fourth violation results in a notice to vacate with option to remedy, cessation materials, referral to a resident services coordinator; and, a fifth violation results in a notice to vacate without option to remedy. Smoking would not be considered a lease violation until after the third violation. This series of graduated enforcement steps should be reset annually upon recertification. PHAs also must have fair eviction processes and procedures for tenants to challenge eviction actions. Absent strong enforcement protocols required by HUD, PHAs could adopt punitive enforcement policies that will lead to unfair evictions. Cessation Activities and Resources In advance of the smoke-free implementation date, HUD should take affirmative steps to collaborate with the Centers for Disease Control, other government agencies, and other organizations to provide a menu of smoking cessation and support resources to PHAs and Resident Advisory Boards. HUD should require PHAs to engage with local health departments or others, including state and local tobacco control and nonprofit health organizations, which provide smoking cessation programs and services. Having a genuine, effective and comprehensive cessation program should be a prerequisite to a PHA being permitted to take any subsequent enforcement measures against a tenant. Prior to the smoke-free rule\\'s implementation date, PHAs should be required to make smoking cessation resources available to tenants, and to provide such materials available to residents who have violated smoke-free policies. The national toll-free quit smoking telephone number should be posted widely, minimally wherever this is a posted \"No Smoking\" sign or other such public reminders of the PHA\\'s smoke-free environment. NLIHC also recommends that any time residents spend taking, or volunteering at, smoking cessation courses be counted toward their community service requirement. Page 3 Smoking Areas / Nonsmoking Barrier NLIHC recommends that PHAs be required to designate smoking areas that are convenient to each public housing building, and that these areas include both shade and seating. This should not be a voluntary activity by the PHA. In the proposed rule, HUD is also considering imposing the smoke-free rule within 25-feet of the public housing building. HUD must address issues with such a perimeter barrier in the forthcoming reasonable accommodation guidance. HUD may have to allow some flexibility for 25-foot stipulation in order to provide reasonable accommodations and to ensure residents do not have to risk their safety to access designated smoking areas. Guidance on Accommodating Persons with a Disability NLIHC is pleased that HUD\\'s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity is developing guidance on accommodating persons with a disability related to smoke-free policies. This guidance should also clearly define opportunities for residents to request reasonable accommodations. NLIHC urges HUD to allow for a comment period on such guidance. NLIHC notes in particular the need for reasonable accommodations for people with mental illness who take psychotropic drugs and who smoke. Psychotropic drug dosage must be measured carefully, and likely adjusted, upon smoking cessation to protect people from dangerous side effects. HUD must require PHAs to provide education and cessation activities that include information about the interplay between nicotine addiction and many psychotropic drugs. One in five adult Americans took at least one psychiatric medication in 2010. In women, the statistic was one in four. Data Collection As part of HUD\\'s smoke-free policy, NLIHC recommends that HUD collect data from PHAs annually on evictions (how many households are evicted, the demographics of these households). Such information will help HUD and other advocates understand whether policies like graduated enforcement protocols protect people from being evicted. New Comment Periods NLIHC recommends that any guidance from HUD regarding reasonable accommodations to the smoke- free policy, as well as national standard protocols for monitoring and enforcement, be issued for public comment. We agree with HUD that smoke-free housing is critical for the health and well-being of public housing residents and we believe any implementation delay caused by multiple comment periods, even shortened, expedited ones, is worth the price of good policy.

LAFLA is thefrontline law firm for low-income residents of Los Angeles, and frequently represents publichousing tenants. For these clients, housing assistance is an absolutely crucial component of theirlivelihood and well-being, and we therefore submit the following comments andrecommendations on the proposed rule instituting smoke-free public housing.IntroductionWe applaud HUD for its goal of protecting the health of public housing residents and employees.However, some provisions of the proposed rule raise concerns that it may not be as protective ofhealth as possible, and may actually increase risks to some residents\\' health in certain situations.These concerns stem from the rule\\'s potential displacement of low-income residents, thedisparate impact the proposed rule may have with regards to race, gender, and disability, thepotential for inappropriate enforcement of the proposed rule, and the lack of cessation and otherhealth assistance required to be provided by PHAs under the rule.Purpose of the Proposed RuleIncluded in the stated purpose of the proposed rule is a blanket requirement that no smokingoccur within 25 feet of PHA buildings. While on its face this may seem reasonable, the blanket25-foot requirement may not be appropriate at every public housing site in the nation. The extentof any non-smoking buffer areas around PHA buildings requires consideration of the specificconfiguration and characteristics of those buildings, and is a determination best made at the locallevel. Further, depending on the particular characteristics of a given public housing site, theblanket 25-foot requirement may make equal access and enjoyment difficult for persons withdisabilities by precluding the establishment of accessible smoking areas. Moreover, the lack ofThe Frontline Law Firm for Poor and Low-income People in Los AngelesTcrflexibility with respect to the 25-foot requirement may decrease opportunities for greaterprotection of all residents\\' health by precluding the consideration of a particular property\\'sunique layout and characteristics. The specific nature of a given development should be takeninto account when establishing buffer areas, and this should be done at the local level with localcommunity input.Potential DisplacementOf particular concern with regard to the health of all residents, smokers and non-smokers alike,is the potential for the proposed policy to lead to terminations and evictions for noncompliance.Indeed, the proposed revision to 24 CFR part 966.4, subsection (f), would make smokingimmediate grounds for eviction as a lease violation. Subsection (1) of part 966.4 states thatgrounds for termination include a \"serious or repeated violation of the lease, such as... failure tofulfill household obligations, as described in paragraph (f) of this section.\" 24 CFR 966.4(1)(2)(B). Given this language, PHAs will thus be able to define smoking as a serious leaseviolation Š effectively creating a one-strike policy for smokers or those who may have smokersas their guests. Without flexibility that allows consideration of the totality of the circumstances,residents and their families could be evicted for single instances of non-compliance, even if itwas a guest and not a member of the household who violated the policy. This, in turn, could leadto drastic health consequences for a displaced family; homeless individuals face far greater ratesof mortality, substance abuse, physical violence and mental illness than the general population.Every effort should be made to ensure the proposed rule\\'s enforcement is carried out in a waythat recognizes the potential health impacts of displacement and PHAs\\' primary duty of housinglow-income populations.Designated Smoking Areas, Disparate Impact re: DisabilityThe proposed rule gives great discretion to PHAs in establishing smoking areas; further, it makesno mention of accessibility in connection with these areas, and makes no guarantee thatdesignated smoking areas will be established. This poses serious concerns for disabled residentswho smoke, but may have reduced ability to leave the public housing development to smoke.While the discretion granted to local PHAs in the design of these areas is appropriate given thevast diversity of public housing developments, smoking areas should be required to beestablished where feasible to avoid negative impacts of the proposed rule on disabled residents.Furthermore, these smoking areas should be required to be ADA accessible.While the proposed rule acknowledges the rights of disabled residents to seek reasonableaccommodations, this does not relieve HUD of its obligation to avoid a rule which will have apredictably disparate impact on disabled residents, when there is a less discriminatoryalternative. Reasonable accommodations are an inappropriate mechanism for addressingpotential impacts on disabled residents; relying solely on the reasonable accommodation processassumes that all disabled residents know their rights with regard to reasonable accommodations,assumes such accommodations will not be denied, and inappropriately places the burden ofpreventing disability discrimination on disabled residents themselves. Further, the reasonableaccommodation process is meant to address specific situations of individual tenants; it is notintended to supplant the requirement that HUD, and local PHAs, avoid enacting a rule which willhave a disparate impact on disabled residents as a class. HUD essentially recognizes that theproposed rule may have such an effect by specifically discussing impacts to this population in itsdiscussion of designated smoking areas. Therefore, HUD should require that accessible smokingareas appropriate for a particular housing development be established where physically feasible,and should give PHAs discretion in deciding the parameters for locating such smoking areas.Disparate Impact re: Race, SexThe No Smoking Policy may also predictably lead to a discriminatory effect with regard to raceand sex due to the demographics of smokers. For example, here in Los Angeles County, maleadults are almost twice as likely to smoke as female adults (19% vs. 10%, respectively), andAfrican Americans are far more likely to smoke than other racial groups (25% vs. 15% ofWhites, 12% of Latinos and 11% of Asian/Pacific Islanders)1. Because of the disparity insmoking rates, a discriminatory racial effect of HUD\\'s proposed policy is both predictable andlikely, given that smokers stand the greatest chance of facing enforcement of the policy. With atiered, cooperative enforcement approach, coupled with meaningful cessation assistance, HUDcould lessen the likelihood of a disparate impact on certain protected groups in the form ofdisproportionate terminations and evictions resulting from the relative smoking rates of suchgroups.PHA ResponsibilityHUD can and should do more to ensure that residents are fully informed about the proposed rulewell in advance of its implementation and are fully supported in their efforts to comply once therule is implemented. PHAs should be required to hold dedicated public information sessions,develop marketing materials, and dedicate resources for educating residents about the rule andthe reasons for its adoption. Examples of in-depth outreach efforts, and their role in ensuringsuccessful implementation of smoke-free policies while avoiding undesirable impacts, arereadily available. The Providence Housing Authority in Providence, RI has made available a200-page \"toolkit\" for PHAs to learn from its successful experience implementing a phasedsmoke-free policy in its buildings, and such programs should serve as a model for HUD\\'sproposed rule.As part of the outreach phase of the proposed policy, HUD should require PHAs to provideserious smoking cessation assistance to its residents and employees. According to the AmericanCancer Society, only 4-7% of smokers are able to quit without assistance or medication. On theother hand, 25% of smokers are able to \"stay quit\" with such help.2 For low-income residents ofpublic housing, some of whom are dependent on public benefits as their sole source of income,the costs of cessation assistance could be too high to afford. For example, nicotine replacementtherapy is estimated to cost between $30 and $100 per month, while prescription medication toaid in smoking cessation can cost $3 to $4 per day. PHAs should partner with public agenciesand/or private companies and smoking cessation groups to provide free nicotine replacementtherapy or other cessation aids, as well as workshops and cessation classes, to those residentswho desire to quit smoking. This would enhance the potential success of the proposed policywhile lessening its potential negative consequences. PHAs have taken this approach both locallyand nationally; examples include the Housing Authority of the County of Los Angeles and theProvidence Housing Authority.1 Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, Office of Health Assessment and Epidemiology.

This hasthe potential to lead to draconian enforcement and undesirable results.The proposed rule would make a resident responsible for ensuring that all members of theirhousehold and all guests comply with the policy, not only when they are visiting the resident\\'sunit, but whenever they are on PHA property. 24 CFR part 966.4, subsection (f), should notprovide for eviction for single instances of guest (or non-guest) non-compliance. HUD\\'s currentproposed revision to this part mirrors the language for illegal drug activity. We strongly urgeHUD to treat instances of smoking differently than instances of illegal drug activity, and torevise subsection (f) accordingly. Smoking is a legal activity that many residents currentlyengage in. And, as discussed previously, any violation of subsection (f) of this part may begrounds for immediate eviction under subsection (1) of this part. HUD should clarify that it is notcreating a one-strike policy for smoking non-compliance.Further, the proposed revision to the CFR does not require that the PHA notify the resident ofany alleged non-compliance on the part of those affiliated with the household, nor does it requirethat the resident have an opportunity to cure the alleged non-compliance, before proceeding withan eviction notice and eviction. This has the danger to lead to an attenuated situation in which,for example, a resident\\'s entire household could lose their home because the resident\\'s child\\'sfriend smoked somewhere on PHA property, away from the resident and their unit, andunbeknownst to the resident. It is unrealistic for HUD to expect residents to exert this level ofcontrol over any person who may be associated with a member of their household, and it wouldbe overly punitive to evict an entire family for an instance of smoking which was not undertakenby any member of that family. While the extension of the rule to guests is necessary to ensure therule\\'s effectiveness, residents should not be required to assume responsibility for enforcing thepolicy against their guests beyond their dwelling unit. Similarly, the proposed rule shouldinclude guidance discouraging PHAs from requiring residents to report on incidents of non-compliance by other residents, as has been proposed by some PHAs. Such policies threatencommunity and neighborhood cohesion, create the possibility for resident conflicts, and couldimplicate residents\\' rights of free speech and privacy.LAFLA strongly urges HUD to require a tiered enforcement approach similar to that utilized bythe Providence Housing Authority. In that case, the Housing Authority used a three-tier systemwherein a resident who violated the smoke-free policy was first issued a verbal warning, then afine. Only on the third violation was termination and eviction made available as an enforcementoption. This approach is preferable to simply incorporating the terms of the No Smoking Policyinto the family obligations and treating their violation as a breach of the lease. Not only would itprotect children and family members not involved in the violation, but a tiered enforcementapproach would better accomplish HUD\\'s goals by maximizing the health benefits of the policywhile minimizing its potential for displacement. In addition, fines collected could be utilized tosupport cessation activities or mitigate the damage smoking causes to units. Finally, a tieredenforcement approach could limit the liability which could be incurred by the negative aspects ofthe policy discussed above.ConclusionLAFLA commends HUD\\'s endeavor to protect and enhance the health of public housingresidents and employees. However, care must be taken in the implementation of the proposedrule in order to prevent adverse health impacts through displacement of certain residents. To thisend, the punitive enforcement approach which HUD has taken in the proposed rule should bealtered to cooperatively address resident health needs through cessation assistance, phasedimplementation with a strong education component, and tiered enforcement. At the same time,PHAs should be given flexibility in how this cooperative enforcement is carried out, to allowthem to explore non-punitive programs that may better accomplish resident health goals. Thiswould bolster the likelihood of the rule\\'s success, protect residents from disproportionatepunishment for violation of the policy, and avoid a discriminatory result which could subjectHUD and PHAs to liability.Thank you for your time and consideration of the above comments.Sincerely,Alexander B.

       " ' January 11, 2016 To whom it may concern: As Executive Directors of the Public Housing program, we feel a deep desire to provide safe and afford -able housing to all of our clients.  Many housing authorities have already voluntarily implemented non- smoking policies following HUD™s published PIH Notices 2012-25 and 2009-21.  Many others will adopt similar policies as they see the effectiveness of the policies implemented by their peers.  The proposed  non-smoking rule is, in our opinion, a step in the right direction; however, we believe it goes a step too  far.  HUD™s proposal to ban smoking within 25 feet of a housing authority building/unit is excessive and  impractical.  Please consider the following points:o Many housing authorities already have non-smoking policies which are working well without such a  restriction. o Residents should not be required to walk 25 feet from their home to indulge in their chosen activities.    impact.o  community room for a smoke break. o Legal issues could arise from denying residents a basic freedom to choose. o The proposed rule does not address enforcement of the rule.  Enforcement of this distance requirement  will be next to impossible.  o  budgetary cuts.   The rule could become another unfunded mandate in order to enforce it effectively.   And for non-discrimination, a covered pavilion would need to be built to accommodate non-smokers.    Where does it end? o The rule is an effort to make units safer and cleaner and residents healthier.  It will fail because telling  residents they may not smoke within 25 feet of a facility is essentially telling them they cannot smoke.   If their physician™s health advice and the warning of lung cancer and death does not force them to stop,  then neither will a rule with this stipulation.  Please accept these points as constructive criticism of the proposed rule.  The majority of directors see the    rule without enforcement and backing is just words on paper.    Thank you for your time and consideration.Sincerely, Cal Davis, President Texas Housing Association ',\n",

       " 'A 00 SAN DIEGO HOUSING SDHC COMMISSION January 15, 2016 Regulations Division Office of General Counsel U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 451 7th Street SW, Room 10276 Washington, DC 20410-0500 To Whom It May Concern: The San Diego Housing Commission (SDHC) supports  HUD\\'s proposed rule that would require every public housing agency in the nation to implement a smoke-free policy (FR 5597-P-02 \"Instituting Smoke-Free Public Housing\"). Nearly two years ago, SDHC implemented its own Smoke-Free Policy on February 1, 2014. SDHC\\'s Smoke-Free Policy prohibits smoking anywhere at the more than 2,000 affordable housing units owned by SDHC and the 154 Federal public housing units operated by SDHC. SDHC\\'s Smoke-Free Policy prohibits smoking lighted pipes, cigars or cigarettes of any kind, including electronic cigarettes and cigarettes made from any weed or plant. Residents, their guests, and SDHC employees or contractors working on-site are not permitted to smoke in: Ł Individual residents\\' apartments Ł Entryways Ł Porches Ł Balconies and patios Ł Interior common areas, such as community rooms, lobbies, hallways, and elevators Ł Within 25 feet of the buildings Prior to implementation, SDHC surveyed tenants, and 65 percent of those who responded preferred a smoke-free building. In addition SDHC gathered information from other public housing authorities that had already implemented a successful Smoke-Free Policy. SDHC also partnered with the American Lung Association to inform SDHC tenants where they could seek more educational information about the health-related issues regarding smoking. San Diego Housing Commission 1122 Broadway, Suite 300 San Diego, CA 92101 619.231.9400 www.sdhc.org SDHC moved forward with its Smoke-Free Policy after a 2012 California law that authorized landlords to prohibit smoking at their rental properties. 2 In addition, SDHC\\'s Smoke-Free Policy also achieved a HUD objective. HUD issued a notice on July 17, 2009, that strongly encouraged public housing authorities to implement nonsmoking policies because \"environmental tobacco smoke can migrate between units in multifamily housing, causing respiratory illness, heart disease, cancer, and other adverse health effects for those living in neighboring residences.\" I commend HUD for its commitment to creating smoke-free public housing.
