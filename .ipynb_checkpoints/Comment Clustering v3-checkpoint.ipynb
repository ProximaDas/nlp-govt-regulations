      "    RE: Proposed Rule by HUD, Docket No. FR 5597-P-02, Instituting Smoke-Free Public Housing       I oppose this rule.  All of the reasons for being against this can already be found in all the other comments that object to it and with which I agree.  So I'll only point out two things that might not have been covered yet.     1)  In April 2014 the Hawaii Public Housing Authority (HPHA) rescinded the same kind of ban in its own properties that it had instituted in February 2013 because HPHA determined that \"it needed a law to be passed before it can make such drastic changes.\"  In other words, this kind of action could not be taken by an agency and must go through the state legislature and voted on by lawmakers.       If Hawaii understood this to be the case then what has made the bans in public housing, imposed by local Authorities scattered around the country, legitimate?  Now as importantly, how can HUD's (an agency) rule be lawful?     (see http://khon2.com/2014/04/25/state-halts-no-smoking-plan-at-public-housing/)        2) Looking at previous HUD Notice H 2012-22, \"Further Encouragement for O/As [Owner and Management Agents] to Adopt Optional Smoke-Free Housing Policies,\" under Section V (\"Requirements for Implementing Smoke-Free Housing Policies\"), it states:    \"The O/A must NOT [emphasis HUD's] have policies that:      1. Deny occupancy to any individual who smokes or to any individual who does not smoke who is otherwise eligible for admission.  2. Allow the O/A to ask at the time of application or move-in whether the applicant or any members of the applicants household smoke.\"     In other words, only no smokING, not no smokERS.     And yet HUD's own actions have been/will be responsible for inspiring just that.       Another's submitted public comment on the current proposed rule (ID: HUD-2015-0101-0405 -- \"the Executive Director of a small Public Housing Commission\") includes this statement:     \"I question all new applicants as to whether or not they smoke. If they say yes, we do not rent to them.\"      HUD's fingerprints will be over this kind of illegal discrimination that is sure to take place as we see it already does.     (See http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=12-22hsgn.pdf - HUD Notice H 2012-22 and  http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=HUD-2015-0101-0405 - Public Comment)                                               \"\n",

The Westlawn Partnership for a Healthier Environment  is a group of community stakeholders  that   has met on a regular basis since 2008 to identify, prioritize, and address environmental  health concerns in the Westlawn community.  Located in northwest Milwaukee, Westlawn is   - subsidized housing development.     Milwauke e County ranks as the worst county in the State of Wisconsin for asthma - related  hospitalizations and emergency department visits.  Moreover, specific to  the  Westlawn   community , the rate of hospitalizations for asthma among children is nearly twice that of  Mi l w aukee County, and the rate of asthma - related emergency department visits is 1.5 times  higher in this community compared to the rest of the county.  Thus, smoke - free housing could  help to   reduce asthma triggers, improve indoor air quality ,   and   improve health outcomes   for  children and families in Westlawn and beyond.       Thank  you for proposing this important rule     it  has the potential to reduce health care costs,  save lives, and improve the quality of life for so many Americans.

      "    Thank you for your concern for my health... I have been a smoker for 40 years, I wish I could quit. If your a non-smoker I'm sure this is hard for you to understand. I am a recovering drug and Alcohol addict. 6 years clean. It seemed easier to stop these addictions than it is for me to quit smoking cigarettes. I have tried over and over to quit...                                                          I'm securing that I live alone and I am in a single family dwelling, (not around children or others that could harm anyone but myself.) I'm diligent about keeping my home clean and well kept. I have never lived anywhere that I did not receive my deposit back from the landlords. I hope when you make a decision on this matter (Smoking in HUD dwellings) that you keep all this in mind) I am a Mental Health recipient that  smoking  cigarettes keeps me calm,Its  legal and for me to have to get up and leave my home and walk down the street could not help me or my mental state. I don't want to break your rules and be left out on the street , homeless .. It would put more burden on the system and the taxpayer in my opinion . I'm disabled major depression, PTSD, Highly anxious and have a hard time going outside in public. I'm not trying to start trouble. Your panel should be aware that in the long run this might not be in the best interest of all your recipients in this matter. I want to thank you for your time... God Bless. Valerie Bishop\n",

      "    This pretty well destroys the Myth of second hand smoke:    Lungs from pack-a-day smokers safe for transplant, study finds.  By JoNel Aleccia, Staff Writer, NBC News.  Using lung transplants from heavy smokers may sound like a cruel joke, but a new study finds that organs taken from people who puffed a pack a day for more than 20 years are likely safe.  What's more, the analysis of lung transplant data from the U.S. between 2005 and 2011 confirms what transplant experts say they already know: For some patients on a crowded organ waiting list, lungs from smokers are better than none.  \"I think people are grateful just to have a shot at getting lungs,\" said Dr. Sharven Taghavi, a cardiovascular surgical resident at Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, who led the new study...........................  Ive done the math here and this is how it works out with second ahnd smoke and people inhaling it!  The 16 cities study conducted by the U.S. DEPT OF ENERGY and later by Oakridge National laboratories discovered:  Cigarette smoke, bartenders annual exposure to smoke rises, at most, to the equivalent of 6 cigarettes/year.  146,000 CIGARETTES SMOKED IN 20 YEARS AT 1 PACK A DAY.  A bartender would have to work in second hand smoke for 2433 years to get an equivalent dose.  Then the average non-smoker in a ventilated restaurant for an hour would have to go back and forth each day for 119,000 years to get an equivalent 20 years of smoking a pack a day! Pretty well impossible ehh!  .\n",

      "        January 19, 2016       The Regulations Division, Office of General Counsel   Department of Housing and Urban Development   451 7 th   Street SW, Room 10276   Washington DC 20410 - 0001   Submitted electronically via   www.regulations.gov         Subject :    Comments on the Proposed Rule Instituting Smoke - Free Public  Housing   Docket No. FR 5597 - P - 02       To whom it may concern :     This letter offers the following comments for consideration in response to  the U.S.   the Department )  solicitation of  comments for the proposed rule Instituting Smoke - Free Public Housing, Docket Number  FR 5597 - P - 02.    Specifically, these comments will address  the third question   posed in the  solicitation notice as well as provide general comments about the potential  effects of this  proposed rule .     Question 3:   Does this proposed rule create burdens, costs, or confer   benefits specific to  families, children, persons with disabilities, owners, or the elderly, particularly if any  individual or family is evicted as a result of this policy?     This is a well - intended public policy that  manages to place   added burden and restr ictions  squarely,  exclusively ,   and with bias  on the shoulders of public housing  participants .   Renters in the private  market , including Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher and Low  Income Tax Credit participants ,  escape the constraints of this policy     even if they are  residing at the same property  and  in the same building .   I n Oakland there are  close to  175,000 units of housing of which public housing r epresents less than 1 percent   of the       A ll  173,600 other apartment units   will co ntinue to allow smoking.    are   75   percent  African   American and  52   percent  of  the households  are  headed by a person that is  either senior or disabled .    T his policy  will   have  negative ,   perhaps  unintended ,   impacts  that   lead to disparate treatment of  these  and other protected  groups .  N amely result ing   in evictions and homelessness among  families  in   the public housing program as a result of a family member being unable to  cease smoking, or  a family member (teenager)  start ing to smoke during their tenancy ,   even if the head of household does not approve .         I mplementation of   this rule on a national level is impossible .    We believe that it would be     v iolations of this rule .   Oakland , like many jurisdictions, has a  J ust  C ause  Ordinance   which details the  lawful  reasons an eviction may be   filed   by an owner , and smoking  tobacco inside a unit is not one of them .     It   is unclear what, if any ,   enforcement power  Oakland Housing Authority   Proposed Rule Instituting Smoke Free Public Housing   Page  2   of  2       OHA or agencies with  similar local  ordinances   would have to impose a   smoke free  policy /law .     This policy is simply unenforceable by th e Housing Authorities and their  management teams tasked with implementing it.     OHA serves over 16,000 households, but  only  1 , 600 public housing   households.   OHA  works   daily  to better   serve  all our families, and is perpetually seeking resources needed  to  fund the operational deficit of the public housing program.  We are a lso  actively  engaged in provide opportunities for all our families, including   their education,  employment and health needs.  We share HUDs intent to create a physical world for our  famili es that is healthier, particularly for our children .   However, we question that  the  rule  will   effect positive change in the health outcomes of our public housing families, and  it  will have no impact on the health outcomes of the over 14,400 we house in oth er  programs .  What it   does accomplish is a dding the responsibility of administering  unenforceable policies that will have a negative impact on  a discrete number of our   families .         OHA  wholeheartedly supports encouraging its residents to practice healthy   habits   and  clearly understands the public health challenges smoking poses ,  but  singling out public  housing  families,   and making them subject to   strict,   and arguably paternalistic rules ,   unfairly imposes restrictions on  them merely because of their addre ss .  OHA  recommends   this program   rule, if enacted,   become voluntary .  We further re c o m mend   that any restrictions to smoking in multifamily properties in this country should impact  everyone equally, and not discriminate against those who are in affordable properties or  a specific affordable housing program .       Thank you for the opportunity to pr ovide  comments   on this notice .       Sincerely,     /s/     Eric Johnson   Executive Director       \n",

      "     I am writing to express our strongest support for the proposed rule regulating lit tobacco products in public housing agencies across the country.  Secondhand smoke affects not only the smoker and their fellow apartment residents; secondhand smoke can drift throughout apartment complexes through vents and doorways and affect neighbors, employees, and even strangers on the street.  Second- and third-hand smoke also affects the safety and economics of multi-unit housing complexes as well.  The use of lit-tobacco products inside multi-unit housing buildings becomes a safety hazard when residents become careless with their items. In Pittsburgh, the Allegheny County Housing Authority has experienced three significant fires in the last twelve years that they can attribute to cigarette smoking.  Unfortunately, one of these fires resulted in a loss of life.  Since then, they have been working with Tobacco Free Allegheny to create smoke-free buildings across all of their properties.  Nationally, smoking accounted for 12.9% of fatal residential building fires in 2013 and 6.6% of fires that resulted in injury.   I chair the American Heart Association's Reduce Smoking Committee with the goal of bringing Pennsylvania from 11% to 50% in the next 3 years for clean air.  AHA supports this proposed rule and encourages all public housing agencies to continue their work to create a safe and healthy environment for their tenants.  \n",

MAHC is a diverse coalition of 120+ developers,  public housing authorities, contractors, design/engineering professionals, investors,  housing and service providers, advocates and others working to increase the supply  of quality afford able housing throughout Maine.       Maine has been a leader in creating smoke - free housing; it was the first state in the  country to ban smoking in all of its public housing and we are well into our second  decade of expanding and refining smoke - free policies   in different types of housing.   Maine Housing now requires all new Low Income Housing Tax Credit units to be  smoke - free.     We encourage you to consider expanding the definition of products covered by the   -    as they may emit nicotine,  propylene glycol, carcinogens, and other harmful substances. In fact, Maine has  adopted a ban on use of e - cigarettes in indoor public places where other tobacco  products are already banned. When adopting the final rule, we hope  that you will  clarify that housing authorities may adopt campus - wide smoking bans as a more  stringent alternative  to the   proposed standards.        HUD is to be congratulated for this effort as a logical extension of green and  healthy homes initiatives that w ill help create healthier living environments for  public housing residents.

The publication of the proposed rule represents  a major step forward in protecting the  millions of Americans who currently live in federally - owned  public housing from the harms of tobacco.    We urge   the   Department of Housin g and Urban  Development   ( HUD )   to adopt a final rule implementing this measure as soon as possible.   At the same time, our organizations believe the proposed rule could and should  also include  electronic  nicotine delivery systems (ENDS)   and  waterpipe   tobacco   (hookah)   in restricted areas .  Our organizations  also believe that the rule should apply to all government - subsidized housing rather than just all  government - owned housing.  Our comments will expand on   these recommendations   below.     2     Our organizations  want   to make clear:  the only way to protect everyone from the dangers of  secondhand smoke is to make the smokefree policies mandatory and make them apply to everyone.   W hile voluntary smokefree policies have been effective   in   allowing   HUD to determine best pr actices for  smokefree policy implementation, voluntary smokefree policies are not sufficient to protect everyone  from secondhand smoke.   policies that delay implementation beyond the  18   month period or allow case - by - case decisions that  would allow some smokers to still smoke indoors.  A  mandatory policy  that applies to everyone from the  beginning of the policy  is  the  only   way   to ensure everyone can breathe clean, safe air in their homes   and  achieve health benefits .     Secondhand Smoke Exposure Poses   Serious Health Threats to Children and Adults   Secondhand smoke (SHS) contains many poisons and cancer - causing chemicals, including nicotine,  carbon monoxide, ammonia, formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, nitrogen oxides, phenol, sulfur dioxide,  lead,  and others. 1   Twenty years ago, in 1992, the U . S .   Environ mental Protection Agency classified SHS as  a Class A known human carcinogen. 2   As such, SHS poses health concerns for all individuals, particularly  children and pregnant women.   The reports of direct health effects of SHS exposure are numerous and growing in   number. The most  comprehensive report of these effects is the 2006 U . S .    The Health  Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke . 3   The report details how even small amounts of  exposure can have serious health effects   and  concludes  that there is no safe level of exposure to  SHS .  SHS can   cause or exacerbate a wide range of adverse health effects, including lung cancer, heart disease,  stroke,  respiratory infections,  sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)   and asthma. 4   The evidenc e supporting the association of SHS exposure of children with respiratory illnesses is strong.  Increased rates of lower respiratory illness, middle - ear infections, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy,  cough, asthma and asthma exacerbations, hospitalizations, a nd  SIDS   have been reported. 5   It has been  estimated that SHS exposure causes asthma symptoms in 200,000 to one million children. 6   One study  indicated that children with asthma who were exposed to SHS had additional co - morbid conditions  including higher leve ls of obesity  compared with unexposed children. 7   The scope of these illnesses is  huge: SHS exposure exacerbates many chronic diseases. Children with sickle cell disease who are  exposed to SHS have a higher risk of crises that require hospita lization than do unexposed children. 8   Finally, in addition to the  exacerbating  chronic conditions, SHS is immediately life - threatening, especially  among vulnerable populations such as infants. In one year alone, SHS exposure  is estimated to have  resulted i n the   death of 900 infants. 9   Another effect of SHS exposure is increased school absenteeism. Analysis of data from the National  Health Interview Survey (NHIS) indicated that 24 to 36   percent   of school absenteeism was related to SHS  exposure in children age s 6 to 11. The study also showed that the number of days that a child was  absent from school predictably increased with the number of active smokers in the household. 10   Even  very low levels of SHS exposure, such as  those  seen in a child with a parent who sm okes only outside, 11   have been associated with decreases in reading and math scores. 12   In addition to SHS exposure for developing children and adolescents, prenatal exposure to SHS has been  associated with   low birthweight, prematurity 13 , and   future susceptibility to nicotine addiction  as well as  significant adverse events in childhood development. One of the significant consequences of prenatal  3     tobacco exposure is sensitization of the fetal brain to nicotine, which results in increased likeli hood of  addiction when the brain is exposed to nicotine at a later age. Studies of rodents 14   and primates 15 , 16   that  were exposed prenatally to tobacco have demonstrated subtle brain changes that persist into  adolescence and are associated with tobacco use, ni cotine addiction, and reduced cognitive function. 17   Population - based human studies have demonstrated associations between prenatal tobacco exposure  and early tobacco experimentation 18   as well as increased likelihood of tobacco use  in adolescence  and  adult hoo d . 19   In addition, further research has indicated adverse developmental effects on infants,  children, and adolescents including lessened perceptual skills, deficits in information processing, and a  significantly higher likelihood of being diagnosed with atte ntion deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 20   Children and the elderly represent a disproportionate ly large   share of fire victims, and smoking  materials are the most common ignition source of fatal residential fires. 21   It has been estimated that  smoking cau ses approximately 30 percent of US fire deaths overall, and that smoking - material fires  accounted for nearly 20   percent   of the 90,000 home structure fire deaths in 2011 according to National  Fire Protection Association data. 22   However, the rate of fire deat hs has decreased as smoking has  decreased, although part of the reduction has been attributed to modifications to cigarette - ignition  resistance in mattresses and upholstered furniture. 23   Residents of  Public   Housing are  Involuntarily  Exposed to Secondhand Sm oke   SHS   is clearly a significant public health hazard, and maintaining a smokefree home is a wise decision to   step  alone is not sufficient to prevent all  exposure to SHS   for residents of multi - unit b uildings . Tobacco smoke does not stay confined within a  single room nor does it stay confined within a single unit in multi - family apartment buildings. Ventilation  systems can distribute SHS throughout a building. 24   SHS can seep through walls and cracks. 25     D ata clearly demonstrate that the residents of smokefree units in multi - family buildings without  smokefree air policies are not safe from tobacco smoke exposure. A Boston - based study published in  2009 measured levels of nicotine, an indicator of SHS exposu re, in 49 low - income units in multi - unit  buildings. Overall, 94 percent of units had detectable nicotine levels, including 89 percent of units where  no one smoked in the home. 26     A 2011 nationally representative study, conducted through the Social Climate S urvey, found that among  individuals who lived in multi - family housing where no one smokes inside the home, 31 percent smelled  smoke in their building. Of these respondents that reported smelling smoke in their building,  approximately half (49 percent) repo rted smelling smoke in their own units, 38 percent reported  smelling smoke in their unit at least once per week, and 12 percent reported smelling smoke in their  unit at least once per day. 27   This nationally representative study confirms the results of sever al state -   and community - level studies measuring prevalence of smoke incursions into smokefree units. 28   This  trend is echoed in a 2012 study that indicated that  although  63 million of the 79 million Americans  who  live in multi - unit housing do not allow smoki ng in their homes approximately 28 million of those  reported secondhand smoke infiltration in their home. 29     Studies published in 2011 and 2012 confirmed that children who live in multi - unit   housing have  significantly higher exposure to  SHS   than those who l ive in detached housing, and that 15 million  children aged 3 - 11 years were exposed to  SHS , representing the highest prevalence of SHS exposure  among all age groups. The studies, using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination  4     Survey (NHANES),   showed that levels of cotinine, a chemical marker of nicotine in the blood, among  children living in multi - unit   housing were significantly higher   than those of chil dren living in detached  housing ;   and that SHS prevalence  compared with adults  was  second - highest among adolescents aged 12  to 19, only superseded by young children. 30 , 31   Prevention of Secondhand Smoke Exposure  Requires   Smokefree Policies   The above evidence clearly demonstrates that residents of multi - family housing are exposed to  SHS   even   if they live in a unit where no one smokes. Therefore, the only way to fully protect children and  adults who live in multi - family housing from secondhand exposure is to implement building - wide  smokefree air policies. In 2007, the World Health Organization   (WHO) presented its clear conclusion that     percent   smokefree environments [is] the only effective strategy to reduce exposure  to tobacco smoke to safe levels in indoor environments and to provide an acceptable level of protection  from the   dangers of  SHS    32   The organization reaffirmed its recommendation in 2014 and  called for a  prohibition  on the use of  ENDS   indoors due to the risks presented by secondhand exposure  to the devices. 33     Partial smokefree policies,  such as  those that pr ohibit smoking in common areas  such as  hallways, will  not protect all residents from SHS. The 2011 Social Climate Survey showed that multi - unit residents in  buildings with the strongest smokefree air policies were the least likely to report smelling smoke.   The  data also showed that policies that only prohibited smoking in common spaces  and not individual  units  did little to prevent residents from smelling smoke. 34   Research  published in  the  American Journal  of Public  Health   has further  shown   that  SHS   exposure   for nonsmokers persist s   despite separating  smokers from nonsmokers within housing, indicating that partial smokefree policies are not effective in  protecting nonsmokers from harm. 35     Experts in building ventilation agree that keeping  individual   unit s   smoke free is  not  sufficient  to   remov e   health risks.  The American Soc iety of Heating, Refrigerating and   Air - Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)   explained in a policy statement   that the only means of effectively eliminating  the  health risk s   associated  with indoor exposure  to  SHS   is to make the   entire indoor area   smokefree. 36   Recent research by public  health professionals has reinforced the fact that scrubbing and ventilating the air in buildings, cannot  completely eliminate exposure SHS and  t he  other harmful substances associated with it. 37     HUD Must Adopt a Nation wide   Smokefree Policy    Our organizations commend the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for its efforts  over the last several  years  to protect the health of residents of federally assisted housing by encouraging  broader adoption of smokefree policies in public housing. In 2009, HUD first encouraged public housing  agencies (PHAs) to adopt smokefree policies, and in 2010, HUD extended th is recommendation to  owners and management agents of  other  federally assisted housing   programs such as the Housing  Choice Voucher program   (also known as   S ection 8 housing ) . A short time  after   for voluntary adoption of smokefree policie s, HUD partnered with the American Academy of Pediatrics,  the American Lung Association, and the Department of Health and Human Services to publish smokefree  housing toolkits   for   both residents and managers of federally assisted housing , which were intende d to  help   in the implementation   of  smokefree policies. Most recently, in 2014, HUD released further  guidance for PHAs and owners of subsidized housing on   implementing successful   voluntary smokefree  policies in their units.    5     To date, over 600 PHAs have succ essfully implemented smokefree policies in some or all units.  None of  these PHAs  have chosen to reverse smokefree policies after  implementation .  Th ese are   important  indication s   that smokefree policies are achievable   and have widespread acceptability after  they are put  in place . However, the current voluntary approach leaves many residents, including 775,000 children,  unprotected from the dangers of tobacco smoke in their own homes. Our organizations strongly support   using smokefree because the only way to protect all residents  of public housing is to adopt a nationwide smokefree policy.   All people, regardless of income, should be able to enjoy healthy housing, free of  SHS   and  other  dangerous conditions.  As private, hi gher - rent, market - rate buildings increasing ly   go smokefree, it is  important that our poorest and most vulnerable citizens not be left out. T he existing lack of smokefree  air policies   in public housing   disproportionately impacts lower - income families  who cannot move due  to   economic, health or other reasons.   Higher - income individuals are better able to relocate their families  to remove them from an unhealthy environment.  Public housing residents are   more   likely to be  member s of vulnerable populations: 3 8   percent   are children, 31   percent   are seniors, 30   percent   are  disabled, a nd 89   percent    38   Further, many residents in multi - family public housing are renters from low - income populations and are more likely to be ra cial or ethnic  minorities, disproportionately exposing these populations to the dangers of SHS exposure. 39   The 2011  Social Climate Survey showed that multi - family housing residents were more likely to smell smoke in  their building if they received governmen t subsidies for their housing. 40   Clearly, the status quo  discriminates against vulnerable populations.   M ulti - unit housing residents consistently report that they desire smokefree air policies.  A   majority of  residents want smokefree air policies implemented  where they live. 41   One study examined the 2012  voluntary implementation of a smokefree policy by the Boston Housing Authority in its housing,  indicating that a year after implementation 91   percent   knew of  the policy prohibiting smoking indoors   and 82   percen t   were strongly supportive of such a policy in their building. 42     While our organizations believe the health and other benefits of making public housing smokefree are  overwhelming, it is likely HUD will receive some comments  opposing  smokefree housing.   One  argument     While  it may be legal to some in some places, it is subject to restrictions on the time and place of  smoking in order to protect the rights o f non - smokers.    Many jurisdictions in the United States have  placed restrictions on where smoking is permitted to protect the health of nonsmokers, and these  restrictions have been almost universally upheld in court cases.    U.S. law supports many restrict ions on the conduct of individuals that affects their neighbors, including  prohibitions on nuisances such as excessive noise levels. Smokefree air policies in buildings do not  prohibit residents from smoking altogether; they only prohibit residents from sm oking in locations that  can cause harm to their neighbors. People who smoke could still be allowed to smoke in outdoor  locations away from the building that would not pose harm to others. Building - wide smokefree air  policies, therefore, do not infringe on  any protected liberties or freedoms afforded to a person who  smokes. Rather, such policies protect the right of all the children and nonsmokers who reside in shared  indoor environments. 43   Smokefree air policies also have collateral benefits for building man agers as nonsmoking units are  significantly less expensive to turn over than smoking units when a tenant moves out. Because turnover  6     costs are two to seven times higher in homes when smoking is allowed, smokefree policies in public  housing can result in mi llions of dollars in savings to PHAs and property managers annually. 44 , 45   Because  the risk of fire is   also   reduced when smokefree air policies are implemented, some insurance companies  offer discounts on property casualty insurance. 46   Reductions in SHS will a lso lead to lower costs to  society, both from decreased health care costs and improved productivity. Smokefree policies may also  encourage existing smokers to quit.   As with any worthwhile public health innovation, there will undoubtedly be implementation c hallenges.  However, as HUD points out, hundreds of PHAs have already implemented smokefree air policies and  found that these challenges are anything but insurmountable. We urge HUD to closely analyze the  comments received in this docket in order to fully u nderstand how these obstacles have been  successfully addressed and overcome in many communities around the nation. We believe that many  commonly cited objections to smokefree air policies  such as a concern that  such measures  will  increase undesirable loite ring outside buildings  have not  posed  significant  problems  when a policy is  actually implemented.   Enforcement has been raised as a particular challenge, with some arguing that smokefree air policies  will result in  increased evictions.  Displacement and/or e viction of residents is an important issue that  can have health and other unintended consequences for residents.   Our organizations have seen that  proper implementation using resources developed by HUD, as well as consistent and uniform  enforcement can pre vent almost all of these challenges.  In addition,  smokefree policy violations should  be treated like any other housing policy violation , e.g.   restrictions on noise levels   and should be  addressed, enforced and respected in the same manner and consistency as   any other housing provision.   Eviction is often a means of last resort for any lease violation and  public housing officials whose  properties have gone smokefree share th at evictions are very rare.     Some have also argued that smokefree policies discriminat e against disabled individuals who may be  less able to smoke outside. In fact,  however,  smoking inside buildings discriminates against the greater  majority of nonsmoking disabled individuals because they cannot escape tobacco smoke infiltrating their  own a partments.  Smoking is not a basic human need and therefore does not require reasonable  accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act.    Nicotine addiction can be addressed using  available, safe,  Food and Drug Administration (FDA)   - approved options   to help smokers quit . These  five  forms of nicotine  replacement therapy  are  available as gum, patch, lozenge, nasal spray, and inhaler   as  well as two non - nicotine medications,  b uproprion and  v arenicline .  Research has shown that with  assistance, smokers can   quit.  Studies have also shown that at least 70 percent of smokers say they want  to quit and over half have made a quit attempt in the past year. 47 , 48    We recognize that some smokers,  especially those with behavioral health or substance abuse issues, may ne ed specially tailored cessation  treatments  that specifically address these issues. In many circumstances those tailored treatments can  be accommodated by working with local health departments and partner organizations .   Overall, the  rights of the disabled  population, including disabled children , veterans,   and those with respiratory  disabilities, are best protected by smokefree building policies that ensure a safe environment for all  residents. 49      Responses to Specific Questions   1.   What barriers that PHAs could   encounter in implementing smokefree housing? What costs could  PHAs incur? Are there any specific costs to enforcing such a policy?   7     Our organizations recognize the greatest challenges to and barriers with implementation are  significantly reduced when there is sufficient lead time before a smokefree policy takes effect.   This time  allows staff to be trained and residents to be empowered  to participate in the rollout and  implementation of the policy.   Resident involvement from the beginning leads to greater buy - in and with  that buy - in comes greater compliance.   Examples of such involvement can include:       Educat ing   staff about why smokefree po  how smokefree policies will lead to reduced fire hazards and how maintenance   costs for units  are   reduced and  turn - over  costs are lower for non - smoking units.       C onduct ing, if resources permit,   a pre -   a nd post - implementation air quality study to detect  SHS   levels in common and non - smoking units.        Conduct ing   resident surveys (please see Appendix A) and focus groups to inform the  development of the smokefree policy.        Schedul ing   multiple meetings with resid ents 2 - 3 months before the policy will go into effect to  share results from the survey, educate residents about the dangers of  SHS , and announce  and/or provide resources for residents who want to quit smoking.      Provid ing   sufficient notification, including l ease addendums and signage, making the policy  known and clear.      Allow ing   residents to help decide where the outside gathering spot for smokers will be.   A kick - off event for residents to celebrate the start of the new smokefree policy has also been a  success ful tactic used by PHAs that have already gone smokefree.      Barriers and less successful implementation are more common when there has been a lack of ad vance   communication with and education of residents.   In a 2010 survey of all public housing authorities  in  Minnesota, conducted by  the Public and Indian Housing   Minneapolis Field Office, the Office of Healthy  Homes and Lead Hazard Control and the American Lung Association of the Upper Midwest,  respondents  were   asked about ob stacles to implementing a smoke fre e policy .   C ompliance and enforcement  were  the  top   obstacle s named   (30%) followed by accommodating current smokers (19%) and losing occupants  (17%). 50     While our organizations urge that everything be done  to help smokers quit, our organizations recognize  the   importance of accommodating those smokers who may not be initially successful.  Previous PHAs  have found that creating  a covered gathering space for smokers or  providing  ashtrays   to be a very  worthwhile expenditure.   Other costs associated with implementin g a smokefree policy mainly relate to  informing residents of the policy, including securing signatures on lease addendums, printing fliers and  purchasing smokefree signs.   However,  as previously mentioned,  smokefree policies will ultimately save  PHAs money   through lower operating and turnover costs for smokefree  units   as opposed to housing  that has been partially or never smokefree .   A 2012 study found that operating costs were lower for  smokefree housing than partially or never smokefree housing properties. 51     As stated above, our organizations strongly recommend HUD include the prohibition of  ENDS  and  waterpipe   tobacco (hookah)   in the final smokefree policy.   Exempting ENDS and hookah  may  make  effective  enforcement   of smokefree policies more difficult.  For ex ample, the  Duluth, Minnesota housing  authority, which allowed e - cigarette use after otherwise going smokefree, reported that when their staff  smelled cigarette smoke, they would knock on the door and residents told them they were using  ENDS . 52     8     Several  early   smokefree policies  were not   comprehensive and did not address smoking on balconies,  patios or by entrances, which also caused implementation challenges.   Our organizations support the  HUD proposal, which addresses both of these issues and protects ten ant health and safety.       As with any policy, staff time will be required for training and communication.   PHAs that have already  gone smokefree have found that staff time associated with enforcement is minimal and similar to the  enforcement of noise and oth er nuisance complaints.     2.   Does this proposed rule adequately address the adverse effects of smoking and secondhand smoke  on PHAs and PHA residents?   In general, for the reasons described above, this proposal  effectively addresses  the adverse effects of  smoki ng and  SHS . However, the proposal could better address these adverse effects by: (1) ensuring  that the policy applies to all federally supported housing, including privately owned housing, (2)  extending  the policy to playgrounds, (3) extending the policy t o   e lectronic nicotine delivery systems  (ENDS), and (4) extending the policy to  waterpipe tobacco ( hookah ) . Each of these issues is discussed in  more detail below.   3.   Does this proposed rule create burdens, costs, or confer benefits specific to families, child ren, persons  with disabilities, owners, or the elderly, particularly if any individual or family is evicted as a result of  this policy?   The U.S. Surgeon General has found there is no safe level of exposure to  SHS . 53   Making all PHAs  smokefree   will lead to an increased quality of life and increased health for every PHA resident, staff  member and visitor.   Residents with health conditions including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease (COPD) and heart disease, will see significant health   improvements once they are no longer  exposed to  SHS , which can exacerbate their diseases.     Youth, children and infants will also significantly  benefit.  SHS   exposure among infants and children causes ear infections, asthma attacks, lung infections  includin g bronchitis and pneumonia and causes an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome  (SIDS). 54 , 55 , 56     The benefits of PHAs becoming smokefree will be realized by individuals and families who face  significant disadvantages. According to the Department of Ho using and Urban Development, 45 percent  of PHA residents are African American (compared to 13.2% of the general population), 37 percent are  children (compared to 23.1% of the general population) and 95 percent are low to extremely low  income.   57   Protecting  these vulnerable populations from the dangers of  SHS   is likely to have a dramatic  impact   and proper implementation will go a long way in addressing the unintended consequences     including eviction and displacement     associated with this policy .       The regul atory impact analysis discusses but does not inc l ude the benefits to smokers who will quit as a  result of the new smokefree policy.  Approximately 70 percent of smokers want to quit smoking, and  adoption of this smokefree policy increases the likelihood th at smokers will quit smoking.  58 Smokers  who successful ly   quit can dramatically improve the quality and length of their lives.     Another financial benefit not properly accounted for in the re gulatory impact assessment   is reduction in  lost productivity costs  attributed to asthma.    absenteeism and when children miss school, their parents miss work. 59    As a result, asthma has a  tremendous economic toll  --   $3.8 billion annually     caused by lost productivity re sulting f rom missed  9     school and work days. 60    In addition to the reduction in healthcare costs that come from a decreased  number of asthma exacerbations, improving the health of individuals with asthma living in public  housing will also reduce the number of  school and work days missed.     The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC)  estimates that cost - savings for renovation costs  will total almost $43 million each year. 61   The smokefree policy will have significant benefits for owners,  who may also expe rience reduced fire insurance costs, as well as residents.    The policy would  also significantly reduce risk for both human and property losses caused by fires.   According to the U.S. Fire Administration, smoking is the leading cause of fatal fires in reside ntial  structures. 62   In the proposed rule, it is estimated there will be a $32 million annual cost savings as the  result of the reduction of fires in PHAs     10 times greater than the regulatory impact analysis estimate of  compliance by PHAs for this regulati on.       Residents who smoke and have mobility issues may have greater challenges with repeat trips outside to  smoke and meet a new smokefree policy that requires smokefree balconies and patios, as well as a 25  foot smokefree zone.   While it is imperative that   smokefree laws be adopted to protect the public    health , some PHAs have worked in advance  with residents who smoke  to relocate them to units closer  to exits or to elevators.   This underscores the need to help all residents, especially those who may have  these physical challenges, with cessation treatments.   A Rhode Island PHA found when it went smokefree  that onsite smoking cessation counseling sessions     either group or one - on - one     were especially  important for and utilized by the elderly and disabled. 63   Evictions must be the very last resort to smokefree policy violations.   As with any other lease violations,  there should be multi - step consequence procedures for infractions.   Smokefree PHAs found that regular  dialogue and direct engagement with smokers, inc luding providing tips on how to comply with the  policy, can lead to success.   Lake County, Illinois Housing Authority begin its smokefree policy in 2008  and while there  were   some documented violations of the policy, there have been no evictions. 64    Duluth,  M innesota      which fully implemented its smokefree policy in 2010     only had one eviction related to its  smokefree policy and PHA officials said that violating the smokefree policy was not the only violation   65   4.   For t hose PHAs that have already implemented a smoke - free policy, what exceptions to the  requirements have been granted based on tenants' requests?   The policy proposed by HUD is to make PHAs smokefree in order to protect all residents, especially  children and o ther vulnerable residents, from the proven dangers of  SHS . Our organizations oppose   a  provision will lead to  enforcement challenges but more importantly, will continue to expos e residents to the dangers of  SHS .   For example, the Duluth,  Minnesota   PHA   not   fundamentally change the nature    of the program or policy. 66   Any exceptions or allowances for  certain tenants to continue to smoke in their units would fundamentally change the nature of the  smokefree policy, which is meant to protect everyone from the dangers of  SHS .   It would also reduce the  savings from maintenanc e costs and increase fire risk relative to a completely smokefree policy.     Instead, as outlined previously, our organizations suggest that building staff work with residents with  physical challenges or mental illnesses who smoke to ens ure they understand t he policy.   Staff might  10     instead relocate smokers so they are closer to elevators or exits to make  outdoor access   easier on  residents.   Further, staff may work with residents who refuse to comply with new smokefree policies to  allow them to move without incur ring expenses related to breaking their lease.    units.   In Duluth, MN, the PHA phased in smokefree policies across a series of buildings, and the last two  were phased in after a year. In addition to the  SHS   exposure continuing for residents in the final two  buildings, a fatal fire occurred in one of the two remaining buildings that allowed smoking indoors.     5.   For those PHAs that have already implemented a smok e - free policy, what experiences, lessons, or  advice would you share based on your experiences with implementing and enforcing the policy?   Our organizations fundamentally recognize the importance of clearly articulating that smokefree polic ies   are   about protecting everyone from  SHS   and not about smokers . Residents must understand that  while  they do not have to quit smoking to live in the building,  they must help maintain a smokefree  environment within the smokefree perimeter established around the b uilding, including inside the  structure .   While our organizations strongly encourage PHAs to partner with local departments of health,  hospitals, community health centers and nonprofit organizations to assist residents who want to quit  smoking, the emphasis   must be on protecting everyone from the dangers of  SHS .     PHAs that have already implemented such policies found that communication and education  were  key  to success.   They also found that a long lead time  was  important to allow for sufficient communication   and education. In some cases, education of staff and residents began more than a year in advance of the  smokefree implementation date so that residents had time to get the help they needed to make a  successful quit attempt. An implementation plan with a l ong lead time also allows for resident surveys  to be conducted,  for sufficient  notice  for residents  about the impending change,  for  staff and resident  education sessions, for signage to be created and for cessation services to be arranged for residents.    B asic education about the dangers of  SHS   and how smoke can migrate between units is necessary. While  many staff and residents may understand that exposure to  SHS   is not healthy, they may not fully  understand how dangerous it is and how it infiltrates betwee n units in multi - unit housing. Officials in  Rhode Island found that most residents wanted to be good neighbors but did not realize that smoke  travelled into nearby units. Another housing authority official found it helpful to ask residents if they  could sm  SHS   travels  similarly.     Other suggestions from smokefree PHAs and our organizations that worked with them include:      Work ing   with tenants to determine whether a designated outside smoking area is appropriate  and if so, where it should be.       Ensur ing   addendums for smokefree policies are included in the lease that outline violations and  consequences.       Document ing   each infraction o f the smokefree policy so that a  record   of all communications  with residents  is  created     including efforts to assist tenants in addition to enforcement.        Listen ing    ing   them ample lead - in time to adjust to the new policy  but a lso enforce it.    11        Help ing   staff and residents understand how smokefree policies will benefit both them and their  neighbors     from the health benefits to the cost savings associated with maintenance and  reduction in fire dangers.          Provid ing   resources to smo kers who want to quit smoking to ensure they have help doing so.  PHAs that are already smokefree have noted that offering cessation assistance  before   the policy  takes effect is critical.       Our organizations also understand and have seen that the vast major ity of tenants are happy with  smokefree policies after they are implemented.   This mirrors satisfaction with smokefree regulations put  in place in other environments including bars , restaurants, and workplaces.   6.   For those PHAs that have already implemented a   smoke - free policy, what tobacco cessation services  were offered to residents to assist with the change? Did you establish partnerships with external  groups to provide or refer residents to these services?   Anecdotal reports from many PHAs that have already   implemented a smokefree policy found that  providing  smoking cessation  services well in advance of the implementation date helps smokers prepare  for implementation and reduce policy violations. In addition, providing quit smoking resources for a  period  after implementation helps smokers who are having trouble quitting and can even show goodwill  on the part of the PHA.       Many of the PHAs that are already smokefree have referred residents to state Quitlines for services.  Some quitlines provide free nicotin e replacement therapy to callers in addition to providing counseling  services. 67   The U.S. Public Health Service has found that combining FDA - approved quit smoking  therapies with counseling services are the most effective for successful quit attempts. 68   Many  PHAs have found it helpful to partner with local public health groups and/or hospitals. The  American Lung Association has worked with PHAs to provide cessation resources via door hangers   and   resident education sessions, tied quitting with promotions such a  American Smokeout, and provided fliers and quit kits for distribution.   In a number of instances, a local  hospital provided group counseling to residents. Rhode Island PHA officials found that onsite cessation  counselin g sessions were most important for elderly and disabled residents, whereas other residents  may find Quitline or text messaging to be more accessible. 69     Recognizing the significant overlap between PHA residents and Medicaid recipients, state Medicaid  progra ms also have the opportunity to increase access to quit smoking benefits including medications  and counseling. According to the American Lung Association, only three state Medicaid programs cover  a comprehensive quit smoking benefit and another 27 states c over all seven FDA - approved medications .  Virtually a l l states still have significant barriers that make it harder for smokers to access that benefit. 70   Partnerships between PHAs, health departments and Medicaid staff can increase access to coverage and  serv ices that will ultimately help residents quit smoking.    Other partnerships might include federally qualified health centers and local health departments that  can also assist smokers in getting the help they need to quit.  We strongly recommend that HUD  cont inue to provide resources and best practices for PHAs to link their residents who smoke to the  cessation services available.    12     7.   Are there specific areas of support that HUD could provide PHAs that would be particularly helpful in  the implementation of the pr oposed rule?   Representatives from many of our organizations who have worked with PHAs recommend:      Template signage, including multiple choices to allow for a variety of building layouts;       Toolkits containing sample timelines on how best to implement smokefr ee policies, education  materials for staff and residents, including sample resident surveys, lease addendums, a sample       8.   Should the policy extend to electronic nicotine delivery systems, such as   e - cigarettes?   Smokefree policies should extend to the use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS).   The  nicotine - containing liquid aerosolized by ENDS  has been found to  contain several harmful compounds,  including heavy metals and tobacco - specific n itrosamines, which  can be  carried over from the tobacco  into the liquid during the nicotine extraction process. 71 , 72   Even propylene glycol, a main ingredient of   respiratory irritation for those exposed to exhaled vapor, even in non - asthmatic patients. 73     There is insufficient research on the long - term effects of using e - cigarettes, which involves regular  inhalation of nicotine, glycerin or some other solvent, and  other additives. 74   According to the CDC, e -  75   E - cigarette aerosol  contains nicotine, which is absorbed by users and bystanders. 76   Studies have found other chemicals and  toxins  present in some e - cigarettes,  including formaldehyde, acrolein, volatile organic compounds like  toluene, tobacco - specific nitrosamines, and metals like nickel and lead. 77   These compounds are  generally present at levels much lower than in cigarette smoke, al though the compounds themselves   78   Because e - cigarettes are not yet  regulated by the FDA and are available in hundreds of different brands 79 , there is no way for consumers  to know for sure  what is in the products or the aerosol. 80   P reliminary animal model data  has shown   damage to growing lungs resulting from second - han d exposure to  ENDS  aerosols . Two studies show  developmental changes and organ effec ts in mice exposed to ENDS aero sols. 81   T he n egative health  impact of   ENDS  on   non - users, including   children ,   deserves more research.    In addition,  the manufacture of ENDS   is currently unregulated by the federal government and there is  not a  standardized method for safety testing. Recent studies have  shown that due to the extensive  variability in design and function, as well as the relative ease with which users may make modifications  to the battery, case, and heating element of these products, explosion and fire hazards have been seen  with these produ cts. 82   An October 2014 report from the U.S. Fire Administration found that improper  use of charging devices can lead to explosion and fire and that because of the shape and size of  ENDS ,   83     In  2015, the Federal Aviation   ENDS   in checked bags.  In the alert, the  FAA highlighted examples of  ENDS   that have caught fire when the heating element was activated by  accident. 84   The report and alert highlight the risk posed to housing units from  ENDS   and underscores  that from a safety perspective,  ENDS   use indoors should also be prohibited.    Lastly, use of ENDS in smoking - restricted areas would make it more difficult to enforce s mokefree  policies since use of ENDS often looks indistinguishable from cigarette smoking.      13     9.   Should the policy extend to waterpipe tobacco smoking? Does such smoking increase the risk of fire  or property damage?   Smokefree policies should extend to the use o f   waterpipe tobacco   ( hookah ) . According to the CDC ,  SHS   from hookah     which comes from both the tobacco and the charcoal typically used to heat it     poses  health risks to nonusers. 85   A study conducted in Virginia showed that air quality in waterpipe cafes  w as  worse than in restaurants that permitted cigarette smoking. It also showed that air quality in non - smoking rooms in waterpipe cafes was poor, demonstrating how  SHS   from hookah can easily travel to  adjacent spaces. 86   One study showed that the exposure   of  nicotine, tobacco - specific nitrosamines, and  cilia/cardio - toxins such as acrolein in children in the homes of daily, and even weekly or monthly,  hookah smokers was significantly higher than in children living in nonsmoking environments,  representing a seri ous threat to child health. 87   The heat source  used with hookah  also poses risks of  fire  and other property damage.   Additional  Recommendations   25 - Foot  Buffer Zone   Our organizations are supportive of the proposed  25 - foot buffer zone from entrances, exits, win dows  and ventilation  intakes of   buildings in the proposed rule , and including patios and balconies in the  policy .  This buffer zone will assist with enforcement by ensuring that  SHS   does not drift back into living  units from outside or require residents ,  staff or visitors   to walk through clouds of  SHS   around entrances  or exits from buildings.    One study that looked at  SHS   exposure outside restaurants and bars found that  exposure to  SHS   was higher than normal outdoor air levels. 88    Some early adopters of smo kefree policies  that did not include a sufficient buffer zone, or allowed smoking to continue on balconies and patios   that  SHS   still came into units when   smoking occurred on balconies, patios or outside windows.       Implementation Timeframe    of the  final regulation being released.  Experiences from the PHAs th at are already smokefree show that  an effective implementation can occur within an 18 month period.  That will allow PHAs to  educate their  staffs, empower and involve their residents in implementation, secure addendums for leases and work  with public healt h partners to ensure residents who want to  quit can get the help they need.    Our organizations also encourage  HUD to finalize this rule within six months   to ensure adequate  implementation before the end of the Administration .     Inclusion of  All   Federally S upported   Housing   The proposed rule would  only apply to public housing, but would not apply to housing units in mixed - finance developments . It would also not apply to p rivately owned, federally sub sidized multifamily  housing such  as  project - based Section 8  housing. The type of housing program a family participates in  should not dictate whether that family is protected from the harms of  SHS . We strongly urge HUD to  apply the smokefree housing rule to all types of housing that are supported by the federal gove rnment.   HUD has been a leader in protecting  children living in housing supported by programs such as Section 8  from the hazards of lead - based paint. SHS exposure has been linked to higher blood lead levels in  14     children. 89   Extending smokefree policies to Sect  efforts to protect the negative health consequences associated with lead exposure.   If HUD chooses not to require all supported housing to implement smokefree   policies, we suggest that  HUD, at a minimum, include smokefree policies in all model lease language published by the agency.   Inclusion of Playgrounds   The proposed rule specifies that PHA s   may prohibit smoking near playgrounds, but unfortunately stops  shor t of requiring that smokefree policies extend to outdoor spaces designed for use by children. We  strongly recommend that the final rule extend the smokefree policy to playgrounds outside the 25 - foot  buffer zone around buildings. It would be  a  serious missed  opportunity if this rule protects children from  SHS   in their homes but fails to protect them where they play outdoors. Therefore, we recommend that  playgrounds and other outdoor facilities intended for use by children be added to the definition of      a 25 - foot buffer zone around such  playgrounds.   Clarification on Indoor Spaces    units and interior common  areas .    We recommend that    from this paragraph in order to clarify that  smoking would be prohibited throughout the entire building. For instance, this would clarify that indoor  spaces where residents are not typically allowed, such as utility rooms and m aintenance facilities, would  also be included in the smokefree policy.   Clarification on  Ability to Prohibit All Tobacco Products    recommended expanding the proposal t o include ENDS and hookah. If HUD chooses not to extend the  policy to either ENDS or hookah, we urge HUD to specify in §965.653 that PHA s   may choose to do so  voluntarily.   Conclusion   Thank you for moving forward on this critical public health issue. We look   forward to continuing to work  with HUD to promote healthy living environments, free of exposure to  SHS , for all children and adults.  Many of our organizations also advocate for smokefree workplace laws as well as policies to ensure that  all smokers have a ccess to proven cessation services to help them quit, particularly smokers who are  newly insured, Medicaid - eligible, and uninsured.
