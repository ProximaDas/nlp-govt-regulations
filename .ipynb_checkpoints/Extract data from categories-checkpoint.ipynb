       " SUMMARY: This action would require a person to carry a pilot \n",
       " certificate with photo to exercise the privileges of the pilot \n",
       " certificate. This proposal responds to section 4022 of the Intelligence \n",
       " Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA). The FAA previously \n",
       " required all pilots to obtain a plastic certificate (excepting \n",
       " temporary certificates and student pilot certificates). This proposal \n",
       " furthers the fulfillment of IRTPA by requiring a photo of the pilot to \n",
       " be on all pilot certificates. The FAA also proposes to require student \n",
       " pilots to obtain a plastic certificate with photo. Student pilot \n",
       " certificates would also have the same duration as other pilot \n",
       " certificates. Additionally, because of the new photo requirements, this \n",
       " proposal modifies the application process and the fee structure for \n",
       " pilot certificates.\n",

       " However, the temporary paper certificate evidencing the added authority \n",
       " must be accompanied by the underlying pilot certificate with photo.\n",
       "     The FAA proposes a 5-year phased implementation schedule. This \n",
       " schedule includes a ``trigger-based'' approach to issue pilot \n",
       " certificates with photos to people interacting with the FAA during the \n",
       " implementation period. The schedule also includes a ``non-trigger-\n",
       " based'' approach that requires pilots to obtain a pilot certificate \n",
       " with photo during a 3-, 4-, or 5-year period depending on the type of \n",
       " certificate. This proposal would not revoke or otherwise cancel a \n",
       " previously issued paper or plastic certificate. It simply would require \n",
       " the pilot to have a pilot certificate with photo to exercise pilot \n",
       " privileges.\n",
       "     The FAA proposes to add a new Sec.  61.6 to prescribe the \n",

       " burden of reissuance on certificate holders, the FAA proposes a \n",
       " concurrent ``trigger-based'' and ``non-trigger-based'' implementation \n",
       " approach.\n",
       "     Many pilots already would interact with the FAA during the \n",
       " implementation period of this proposed rule because of a ``triggering \n",
       " event.'' They would be required to apply for a pilot certificate with \n",
       " photo as a result of that interaction. One triggering event would be \n",
       " applying for a new pilot certificate or rating, including a student \n",
       " pilot certificate. A pilot obtaining a new flight instructor \n",
       " certificate or renewing a flight instructor certificate would also be \n",

       " pilot certificate. The FAA does not propose requiring all persons \n",
       " requesting replacement pilot certificates during the implementation \n",

       " replacement activity requiring an in-person interaction with the FAA \n",
       " (for example, change of name, citizenship, date of birth, or gender) \n",
       " would be a triggering event. The FAA proposes to require pilots \n",
       " interacting with the FAA during one of these triggering events to \n",
       " provide a photo with the application. These pilots would not be subject \n",
       " to the proposed phase-in requirements because they would already comply \n",

       "     Because not all pilots will have a triggering event during the \n",
       " implementation period, the FAA proposes a phased approach for requiring \n",
       " an application for a pilot certificate with photo. A pilot with an \n",
       " airline transport pilot (ATP) certificate would have 3 years after the \n",
       " final rule becomes effective to obtain a pilot certificate with photo. \n",
       " A person with a commercial pilot certificate would have 4 years after \n",
       " the effective date of the final rule. Finally, a private, recreational, \n",
       " or sport pilot certificate holder would have 5 years after the \n",
       " effective date of the final rule. Pilots who do not obtain a \n",
       " certificate with photo during the appropriate period would not be able \n",
       " to exercise pilot privileges after the cut-off date.\n",
       "     The FAA chose different cut-off dates based on certificate level to \n",
       " provide the most time for private, sport, and recreational pilots. \n",
       " Those pilots are the least likely to have regular contact with the FAA. \n",
       " ATP and commercial pilot certificate holders usually have more regular \n",

       "     The FAA believes that these periods are reasonable to allow for the \n",
       " timely replacement of pilot certificates. The phased implementation \n",
       " approach balances the FAA's ability to receive and process applications \n",
       " for replacement certificates and to maintain the FAA's existing range \n",
       " of services. The FAA assumes that applications would be evenly spread \n",
       " throughout the implementation period. If all pilots wait until close to \n",
       " the end of the period to apply for the certificate, there undoubtedly \n",
       " would be delays in processing and receipt of the new certificate. A \n",
       " pilot may apply for a certificate with photo after the specific \n",

       " in-person application is required. If the photo would expire within 90 \n",
       " days of the application, a pilot would submit the application in \n",
       " person. A pilot changing vital information on the certificate, such as \n",
       " name, date of birth, citizenship, or gender, would still be required to \n",
       " apply in person so the FAA could verify the applicant's identity. \n",
       " Finally, a pilot who upgrades his or her certificate or adds a rating \n",
       " would still apply for a new certificate in person.\n",
       "     A pilot who wants to add or update the photo on the certificate may \n",

       " Duration of Pilot Privileges for a Pilot Certificate With Photo\n",
       " \n",
       "     Because the accuracy of a photo degrades over time, the FAA \n",
       " proposes to include a photo expiration date on the pilot certificate \n",
       " with photo. As under current regulations, the actual pilot certificate \n",
       " would not expire but would remain valid unless surrendered, suspended, \n",
       " or revoked. However, the pilot may not exercise the privilege of the \n",
       " certificate after the photo expiration date. Therefore, the pilot must \n",
       " renew the photo in order to continue to exercise the pilot privileges \n",
       " of the certificate past the photo expiration date.\n",
       "     The FAA considered different photo durations, specifically an 8-\n",
       " year duration (similar to that required by the Real ID Act) and a 10-\n",
       " year duration (similar to that used for passports). The Real ID Act of \n",
       " 2005 \\4\\ imposes certain security, authentication, and issuance \n",
       " procedure standards for state driver's licenses and identification \n",
       " cards for them to be accepted by the federal government for official \n",
       " purposes. The FAA acknowledges that the Real ID Act does not require \n",
       " the FAA to set any specific duration with respect to a pilot \n",
       " certificate with photo. The Department of State traditionally has \n",
       " issued passports that are valid for 10 years. This practice was \n",
       " established well before the Real ID Act became law and was established \n",
       " in response to different concerns than those to which the Real ID Act \n",
       " responds. The FAA proposes an 8-year duration. This duration is \n",
       " consistent with the Real ID Act, which is Congress's latest expression \n",
       " on the appropriate period of validity for government identification. \n",
       " The FAA proposes to amend Sec.  61.19 to prescribe a photo expiration \n",
       " date of 8 years after the month in which the FAA issues the pilot \n",

       " significant regulatory action'' but is a ``significant regulatory \n",

       " Summary\n",
       " \n",
       "     In this analysis, the FAA estimated future costs for a 20-year \n",
       " period, from 2010 through 2029. All costs in this analysis are in 2008 \n",
       " dollars.\n",
       "     There are currently about 740,000 pilots and 93,000 CFIs that would \n",
       " be covered by this proposal. Given future projected growth in all pilot \n",
       " categories and given the requirement to renew every 8 years, the FAA \n",
       " anticipates that the FAA would process 4.40 million photo IDs from 2010 \n",
       " to 2029.\n",
       "     Costs to pilots would sum to $445.8 million ($235.8 million, \n",
       " present value) over the above 20-year period. This includes the costs \n",
       " of the pilots providing hard copy photos and a Form 8710-1 to a portal \n",
       " designee, either a Knowledge Testing Center, Designated Pilot Examiner, \n",
       " or Flight Service District Office. These portals would incur costs of \n",
       " $33.2 million ($17.6 million, present value) to process this \n",
       " information and pass it on to the Airman Registry at the FAA. The FAA \n",
       " would incur costs of $239.8 million ($126.7 million, present, value) to \n",
       " process the certificates. Total costs, over 20 years, sum to $718.7 \n",
       " million ($380.1 million, present value).\n",
       "     This proposal responds to IRTPA by requiring digital photos on all \n",
       " pilot certificates. Congress has mandated that the FAA improve pilot \n",
       " licenses by including a photo on the license. The proposal requiring \n",
       " owners to personally appear before authorized persons and to produce \n",
       " proof of identity including photo identification would be a significant \n",
       " help in the prevention of fraudulent and fictitious registration.\n",
       " \n",
       " Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination\n",
       " \n",
       "     The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) establishes ``as a \n",
       " principle of regulatory issuance that agencies shall endeavor, \n",
       " consistent with the objective of the rule and of applicable statutes, \n",
       " to fit regulatory and informational requirements to the scale of the \n",
       " business, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions subject to \n",
       " regulation.'' To achieve that principle, the RFA requires agencies to \n",
       " solicit and consider flexible regulatory proposals and to explain the \n",
       " rationale for their actions. The RFA covers a wide-range of small \n",
       " entities, including small businesses, not-for-profit organizations and \n",
       " small governmental jurisdictions.\n",
       "     Agencies must perform a review to determine whether a proposed or \n",
       " final rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial \n",
       " number of small entities. If the determination is that it will, the \n",
       " agency must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis as described in \n",
       " the RFA.\n",
       "     However, if an agency determines that a proposed or final rule is \n",
       " not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial \n",
       " number of small entities, section 605(b) of the 1980 act provides that \n",
       " the head of the agency may so certify and a regulatory flexibility \n",
       " analysis is not required. The certification must include a statement \n",
       " providing the factual basis for this determination, and the reasoning \n",
       " should be clear.\n",
       "     A number of commercial pilots are employed as crop dusters, as \n",
       " passenger and freight charter operators, in aerial photography and \n",
       " mapmaking businesses, in sightseeing businesses, and/or in flight \n",
       " schools, many of which are small businesses. The FAA does not have data \n",
       " as to how many such pilots are employed in each of these businesses. \n",
       " While in a rural setting, the entire process may take half a day, the \n",
       " pilot would have large latitude in choosing which day to get the \n",
       " certificate. These types of small businesses are often seasonal, \n",
       " meaning that in almost all cases, the pilot would not have to miss a \n",
       " day of work in order to get a pilot certificate with photo.\n",
       "     The cost impact to any one pilot and to any business would not be \n",
       " large. The average cost to a pilot in a ``non-trigger'' event is higher \n",
       " than that of a ``trigger'' event as the time and mileage needs to be \n",
       " taken into account as well as the portal costs. The average cost for a \n",
       " ``non-trigger'' event is about $175. These commercial pilots would have \n",
       " a phase-in period of 4 years and then would have to renew every 8 \n",
       " years. Thus, over a 20-year period, such a pilot would have to get 3 \n",
       " pilot certificates, for a cost of about $375; the average annual cost \n",
       " is $19, which is not a significant impact.\n",
       "     Therefore, the FAA certifies that this proposed rule would not have \n",
       " a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small \n",
       " entities. The FAA solicits comments regarding this determination.\n",
