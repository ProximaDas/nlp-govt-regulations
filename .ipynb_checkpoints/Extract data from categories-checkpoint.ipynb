       "{'comment_list': ['- I have added additional commentary to my original comment, with the full comments below:\\n- How much discussion has there been regarding a flat fee option, rather than being based on the number of appraisers doing business with the AMC? Commentary and discussion have likened this ASC fee to the fee embedded in appraiser\\'s state renewal fees; however, their is a significant difference: appraisers are not paying their ASC fee based on how much they work - it is a one-sized flat fee. While the impact of a per-appraiser fee could easily be absorbed by large AMCs, it could have significant negative impact on smaller, local, and regional AMCs that provide service to lenders, banks, and credit unions. Additionally, a flat one-sized fee, rather than a per-appraiser fee, would be more easily calculated, enforced, and collected, and would have less impact on AMCs.\\n- Nevertheless, in the absence of an apparent consideration of a flat one-sized fee option, the option (third) for calculating the number of appraisers to count is a good option (of those discussed in the proposal): counting only the number of appraisers who have actually performed services, and excluding appraisers who may simply be on an \"active\" panel with the AMC but have not actually performed appraisal services during that time. \\n- Using the third option in the rule would not \"penalize\" AMCs that choose to pro-actively build a panel of appraisers who have necessary qualifications, experience, quality of work samples, etc. in order to more quickly assign client\\'s orders when requested. The alternative that some AMCs might otherwise choose would be to populate an appraisal panel only at the time a lender-client has a request; the screening and approving of appraisers can be time-consuming, so the freedom to build and manage panels ahead of time without fear of additional costs, under the third option, makes sense. \\n- In terms of state burdens (note I am not a state regulator), I believe the use of the third counting method is useful for states, as it would be in line with processes some states already require and request. For example, some states already ask an AMC during an audit for a list of assignments from during a certain period of time. Typically, the appraiser name and or license number would be transmitted with this data. From this data, both the AMC and the state regulator could know the appropriate count of unique appraisers. Again, a flat one-sized fee would eliminate the burden on states, AMCs, and the ASC in terms of tracking, counting, reporting, etc.\\n- Clarification could be useful, that ordering reviews or additional appraisals for audit type purposes do not count, as those services are not conducted for a lender-client, but rather are for internal AMC purposes only.',\n",

Since we cannot discuss it with them they think the entire fee they are asked to pay goes to the appraiser.  We are the first one they want to argue with and the first one they want to sue when things go sideways.  Assess the AMC a fair fee, do not allow them to pass it on to the appraiser, make them disclose their cut of the fee to the homeowner, and for goodness sake hold their feet to the fire on Reasonable and Customary fees.

Are they going to raise the fee they pay me?\\nRequiring me to pay fee to on their panel, is nothing more than a pure profit making \"tax\" laid in the back of the appraiser. \\nThis fee is part of their daily business expense and not mine.\\n\\nDue to the implementation of Dodd Frank many lenders have moved to the AMC model for appraisal ordering. In order to maintain my business with clients I have had for over 16 years I had to join an AMC panel, so I could receive work.

Often times I received orders with fees from $25-75 less than I was paid before. \\nRecenlty due to legislation at the state level and years of trying we are finally beginning to receive work from many AMC at a competitive level.\\n\\nNow they want to charge me $25/year to be on their panel or I can not receive work.

Additionally I foresee the proposed change will cause an increased compliance burden for appraisers as AMCs work to determine which appraisers are on which panel in which year.\\n\\nThe cost of this oversight should be born by the AMCs, not the appraisers they employ.   This is the likely outcome should the proposed rule proceed on it\\'s current funding basis.\\n\\nAs an alternative...    A better methodology would be to assess the fee based on the total number of federally regulated assignments completed by all of an AMC\\'s roster appraisers for the previous 12 month term (however defined by an individual state).  This funding basis can be roughly analogous, would remove the direct one-to-one passing on of the new fee to contracted appraisers, would relieve the tightening of the appraiser pool, would relieve the additional compliance burden for appraisers, and would reduce any additional pressure on appraisers to strain the bounds of their geographical competence.\\n\\nIt might be said here that additional AMC protections such as a required \"default pool\" against AMC non-payment (such as Kentucky requires), addressing the pass-through nature of liability under the current AMC paradigm (AMCs do not generally accept any liability for the final product), and protections against AMC stipulation of burdensome assignment conditions which regularly usurp the appraisers mandate to determine the scope-of-work for any particular assignment, might be in order.\\n\\nWe appraisers, all of us, want to, have the space to do the very best work possible on behalf of the public\\'s trust and in support of the good and orderly transfer of real property among market participants.

Our expenses continue to rise while fees continue to decline because AMCs have and continue to operate contrary to the intent of the C & R portion of Dodd-Frank, which was to preserve appraisers earning power and not permit AMCs to pay appraisers less than they were earning prior to HVCC/Dodd-Frank.\\nPlease do not in any way allow AMCs to pass their operating expenses onto appraisers.

Per Dodd-Frank Act the Appraiser should be paid a customary and reasonable fee without the burden of then having to essentially pay back operating costs for the AMC or Lender.\\n\\nI routinely receive requests for some of the most complicated orders one might imagine and yet the offered fee may be 50% of private study C&R fees. Yet another scenario is the AMC that has a \"fee structure\". If an appraiser has their name placed on that list, suddenly the AMC determines those fees to C&R even if they were put into place years ago. So basically all burdens are placed on the appraiser. Yet another scenario is the AMC that states \"we\\'re tying to get you guys higher fees!\" ... well, to the AMC, I say, no you are not because if you were, all you have to do is refuse to work with lenders that will not pay appraises C&R fees.\\n\\nSo if the Dodd-Frank Act truly intended to provided C&R fees to appraisers, provide transparency to consumers, and regulate the AMC business, then these entities need to be clearly separate as there are still many AMCs that are no more than order packagers and shippers. By many requests I receive it is clear their intentions are simply to accept an order from a lender, pull it off the warehouse shelf, and have it shipped back to the lender as quickly as possible while retaining as much of any collectable fees as possible.\\n\\nI have experienced this both as an appraiser and a consumer. When I apply for a loan, sign a letter to pay $460 for an appraisal to an AMC, then find out the lender is using the AMC that I do work for. However the AMC will offer me the order for $350 and if I counter to C&R the order is cancelled.\\n\\nConversely, I have met homeowners that told me they paid $460 for my appraisal, yet I\\'m standing there with an order form stating that if I speak of the fee I receive it will be grounds for my removal from their panel and knowing full well I am not being paid that fee. All the while, the consumer, if they even know an AMC is involved has no idea what they do. In many cases it is certainly not what their name implies. Many should perhaps be named FMCs or Fee Management Companies.\\n\\nSo it is painfully clear to me that the appraiser nor the consumer are being protected here and the only solution is rulemaking that prevent the AMC from being able to operate in this manner. \\n\\nRespectfully.\\n\\nThomas W Baldwin',\n",

Secondly, AMC's require the appraiser to not include the appraisers invoice within the appraisal report which is deceiving the borrowers, or intended users of the cost of the appraisal. Therefore it should be made mandatory that appraisers include their invoices which shows the actual cost of the appraisal within the appraisal report and that AMC's pay any transmission fees of the appraisal.

The ASC requests comment on the ASC \\'s interpretation of the phrase \"working for or contracting with. \" The ASC\\' s proposed interpretation under§ 1102.402(a) states the registry fee shall be, \"In the case of an AMC that has been in existence for more than a year, $25 multiplied by the number of appraisers who have performed an appraisal for the AMC in connection with a covered transaction in such State during the previous year.\" RRR feels the ASC\\'s proposed interpretation properly balances the requirements under the Federal law, while limiting the excessive financi~l burden on AMCs that could be created by a more expansive interpretation of \"working for or contracting with.\" However, we point out that the AMC registry fee associated with this definition will impose a substantial financial burden on AMCs. For example, under the proposed interpretation, the AMC will be required to pay $12,500 annually for every 500 appraisers who complete appraisal services. For national AMCs, who work with several thousand appraisers annually, the registry fee could easily exceed $100,000 each year. Such a fee may well incentivize AMCs to limit the number of appraisers with whom they \\nwork, which could negatively impact the appraiser industry. The other alternative interpretations (the first and second options) of \"working for or contracting with,\" would increase registration fees even further, as they would require AMCs to include appraisers that did not complete an appraisal assignment for the AMC in a given year. If the first or second option is adopted, the registry fee examples noted above would be increased several fold, with no additional appraisal assignments completed. This would significantly increase the operating costs for AMCs even though no additional work product was created for the AMC. It would also increase the likelihood that AMCs will substantially curtail the number of appraisers with whom they work. As stated above, RRR commends the ASC for its efforts in implementing the Proposed Rules in a fair and effective manner. We support that the interpretation of the Proposed Rule limits \"working for or contracting with\" to appraisers that have completed appraisal assignments. We agree that the registry fee should be limited to appraisers that performed an appraisal, and that the ASC should not adopt the other suggested 3217 S. Decker Lake Dr., Salt Lake City, Utah 84119 interpretations, as they would impose excessive fees on AM Cs and could negatively impact the appraisal industry by decreasing the number of appraisers that might be hired by a national AMC. \\nPlease do not hesitate to \\ncontact me if you have additional questions regarding this comment. ·\\'N-4~(ham RRR Appraisal Services, Inc.

Despite this, some Appraisal Management Companies (AMC's) are still charging excessive surcharges or taking as much as half (and more) of an appraisers fee, prohibiting appraisers from being paid a reasonable and customary fee. AMC's are inappropriately requiring appraisers to pay fees as a prerequisite to being added to an appraiser panel, and as prerequisites to receiving orders. These surcharges are being deducted from the mandatory minimum customary and reasonable fees paid to appraisers to pay for expenses incurred solely by the appraisal management company. AMC's need to be held responsible for ensuring appraisers are compensated at a rate that is customary and reasonable and need to be forbidden from charging any fees that prohibits a full customary and reasonable payment. The cost oftechnology, regulation, registry fees and other operating expenses of AMC's are not the responsibility of the appraiser. An appraiser's customary and reasonable fee should not be based on the variable operating expenses of the management company. Individual states, with the help of state appraiser coalitions, are drafting bills that would emplace new AMC regulation or replace current AMC registration laws. These bills include provisions that an appraisal management company shall not require an appraiser to pay the specified appraisal management company national registry fee assessed by the Appraisal Subcommittee; require an appraiser to pay any fee directly or indirectly to an appraisal management company; or to reimburse an appraisal management company for any costs, fees, or other expenses incurred solely by the appraisal management company as a prerequisite to an appraiser being added to an appraiser panel; or as a prerequisite to an appraiser receiving an order for an appraisal from an appraisal management company; or deduct any amount from the reasonable and customary fee paid to an appraiser for any costs, fees, or other expenses incurred solely by the appraisal management company. Many appraisers are asking why the federal government and/or those that have made all these changes since 2009, changes that have literally put appraisal companies out of business, can't correct or revise some simple rules that require the AMC's to operate on their o\\\\vn budget, not off the backs of the appraiser. It must be made clear in the rulemaking that AMC's should not be allowed to directly or indirectly require any appraiser to pay a surcharge for the cost to operate the AMC. Help to protect the consumer and increase appraiser's independence by making it clear that real estate appraisers should receive the entire customary and reasonable fee, one that is not eroded by the operating cost of management companies.

I firmly disagree with this fee being passed down to us as Appraisers. This should be part of the cost of business for the individual AMC's. Please make this clear in the final draft. Over the last several years as individual fee appraisers we have had to continually fight for customary & reasonable fees, pay additional upload/technology fees that average $9.00 to $45.00 per appraisal depending on the AMC and which platform they utilize for delivery. For instance Mercury Network charges $13.75 per appraisal order that comes through them. I paid several hundred dollars to this one company to receive business in 2015. To pass yet another fee down to us seems burdensome and unfair at best. All of our cost of doing business continue to increase, we have to fight for the fees we earn, and have to pay additional fees to have our appraisal's uploaded to the AMC's-please do not pass one more fee down to us.

According to the Proposed Rule, the ASC intends to issue an ASC Bulletin that will address reporting requirements. Because ASC has not yet issued this bulletin, the Board is unclear as to the extent of ASC requirements in terms of collection of information. Therefore, the Board's comment will be limited to the accuracy of ASC's assessment of State Reporting Burden and ways to minimize the burden of collection of information by states. The ASC estimated 500 hour burden total. The Board firmly believes that the 500 hour estimate is grossly underestimated. It is unclear how ASC calculated the 500 hour estimate, but the Board submits that ASC failed to consider administrative costs and expenses for creating an administrative and computer based infrastructure and procedures for the registry; staff time involved in verifying information and fees on an annual basis; documentation and tracking of fees; staff time in assisting AMCs regarding the process and procedures; and enforcement or DEPARTMENT OF STATE/OFFICE OF CHIEF COUNSEL 2601 NORTH 3RD STREET/P.O.

Although the Board is not able to provide specific projected expenses, it is difficult to envision a scenario where 500 hours would allow states sufficient time to ensure compliance with the collection and transmission processes that will be required. The Board asks the ASC to consider expending money as permitted by Section 1109 of Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, as amended, 12 U.S.C. § 3338, to support it activities by contracting for and developing an internet based application that would collect the necessary annual information and allow for the submission of fees. Such an application could be provided to states and states could facilitate the collection of information and fees, as required by FIRREA. Such a coordinated effort would lessen the administrative and financial burden on states. On behalf of the Board, I thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Proposed Rule.

Of the proposed fee collection scenarios, the third option appears to be the most equitable as fees are assessed for actual work performed. The Colorado Division of Real Estate does not have the resources or capacity to individually track each appraiser working for or contracting with each AMC licensed in our state. For that reason, it would be our expectation that each AMC would need to self· report the appraisers that were on their respective panels during the prior year at the time of license renewal. Colorado does have one barrier to implementing any type of regulation that requires the state to collect fees on individuals or companies that are exempt from state licensure. The practice act enables the Colorado Board of Real Estate Appraisers to collect fees for the National Registry from holders of state licenses or certificates. We do not have the authority to collect AMC registry fees for entities exempt from state licensure, nor do we have any authority to require that they submit data to the state board. The Appraisal Subcommittee should collect those fees directly, along with gathering any relevant information about the state exempt AMCs and tracking the appraisers working for or contracting with those entities.

Summary of comments below: The cost of annual registration fees of appraisal management companies must be an expense of the AMC alone. This fee must not be passed through to the appraisers. It is a cost of doing business to the management company. Any new rule regarding fees of this sort must clearly state the AMC is solely responsible for those fees and provide for a punishment I fine of the AMC if they do pass the fee through to the appraisers. This is for the good of the profession. Raising fees on the appraisers that stayed in the business after Dodd-Frank mandated appraisers take pay cuts will further reduce the number of working appraisers. Extended comments: When the Dodd-Frank Act created the need for Appraisal Management Companies it simultaneously cut appraiser's pay by 30% to SO% per appraisal. This led to a mass exodus of trained and working appraisers out of the business. Adding fees will lead to more appraisers leaving the business. To become an appraiser now requires a college degree and a two year apprenticeship. This is a very high barrier to entry into the profession. 1 \",\n",

These \\ntechniques \\ninclude\\n \\nthe following\\n:\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nThe inclusion in an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking, if issued, o\\nf a statement\\n \\nthat the \\nproposed rule may have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small\\n \\nentities\\n;\\n \\n\\n \\nThe publication of \\na \\ngeneral notice of proposed rulemaking in publications likely to be\\n \\nobtained by \\nsmall entities;\\n \\n\\n \\nThe direct notificati\\non of interested small entities;\\n \\n\\n \\nThe conduct of open conferences or public hearings concerning the rule for small entities,\\n \\nincluding soliciting and receiving comments over computer networks; and\\n \\n\\n \\nThe adoption or modification of agency procedural rules to r\\neduce the cost or\\n \\nc\\nomplexity of participation in the rulemaking by small entities.\\n \\n \\nThe ASC claims\\n \\nthat\\n \\nthe rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small \\nentities\\n1\\n \\nwhen, in fact, many of these registry fees likely \\nwill \\nbe passed through to real estate appraisal \\nservice providers, the vast majority of which are small businesses. \\nThis proposal only focuses on state \\nboards and AMCs and does not consider \\nflow\\n-\\ndown impacts on \\npracticing real estate \\nappraisers. \\nWe \\nstrongly sus\\npect that the\\n \\nproposed AMC registry fees, barring any state law prohibitions\\n2\\n, simply \\nwill \\npass \\non \\nthrough to the contract appraiser. This undoubtedly \\nwill \\naffect thousands of small business real estate \\nappraisal firms across the country. \\nBecause \\nmany appr\\naisers \\nmay \\ncontract with multiple AMCs, the bill to \\nsmall businesses likely \\nwill \\ncost\\n \\nthousands of dollars on an annualized basis.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                                        \\n                  \\n \\n1\\n \\nThe proposal states \\nthat \\n\\n\\nimpacted \\n\\n \\n2\\n \\nTexas enacted policies in 2011 and 2012 that collectively prohibit \\nAMCs from requiring appraisers \\nto \\npay AMC registry fees.

The ASC should conduct appropriate outreach with small entities in \\naccordance with Section 609(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act and reissue a proposal that adequately \\naddresses the signif\\nicant economic impact on small entities.\\n \\n \\nActual Economic Impacts\\n \\nThe actual economic impact \\nof \\nthis proposed rule \\nis \\nsignificant for small businesses. \\nWhile it \\nis true that \\nthere are only 400\\n-\\n500 AMCs registered by state appraiser regulatory agencies toda\\ny\\n, this is the required\\n \\nprojected figure for the ASC to consider as small businesses under the Administrative Procedures Act. \\nIn \\nfact, most AMCs in \\nthis total also \\nare \\nsmall businesses\\n \\nthat\\n \\nwill feel the direct effects of the proposal. \\nAnd \\nthis \\nproposal ma\\ny\\n,\\n \\nin fact\\n,\\n \\nforce \\nsmall\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nmedium\\n-\\nsized AMCs out of business, \\nbut\\n \\nnot without \\nfirst \\npassing on the cost of \\nthe \\nregistry to real estate appraiser practitioners.  \\n \\n \\nBeyond the AMCs themselves, \\nAI \\nestimates indicate that this proposed rule indirectly \\nwill affect \\n15,000\\n-\\n25\\n,000 sole proprietorships\\n, a figure that \\nthe ASC \\nalso \\nshould use for \\ncompliance with the Regulatory \\nFlexibility Act. \\nThis is a conservative projection derived \\nfrom \\nAI \\nresearch\\n,\\n \\nwhich reports \\nthe latest number \\nof active certified and li\\ncensed real estate appraisers (76,100). Of this figure, approximately \\n58 percent \\nare Certified Residential appraisers (44,138). \\n \\n \\nApproximately \\n62 percent of residential appraisers are self\\n-\\nemployed or sole proprietors with no \\nemployees or partners. A\\n \\nsimi\\nlar percentage (roughly 60 percent) \\nreports accepting assignments from \\nAMCs. \\nThese figures do not include Licensed \\nResidential \\nreal estate appraisers, who are \\nsolely \\nresidential\\n-\\nfocused. \\n \\n \\nCost\\n-\\nBenefit Analysis\\n \\nAs \\nan independent\\n \\nagency, the ASC is not required to \\nadhere to Executive Order 12866 or \\nissue a cost\\n-\\nbenefit analysis of the proposed rule. Still, we believe that it is a sound best practice for a federal agency \\nto do\\n \\nso\\n \\nin a proposal of this magnitude. \\n \\n \\nThe ASC has not pr\\novided an estimated revenue projection from the proposed rule. Further, it has not \\noutlined \\nhow much the \\nAMC Registry \\ndevelopment will cost the ASC. On the surface, the Registry does \\nnot \\nappear to \\nrequire a great deal of time or effort since states already\\n \\nreport information to the ASC. \\nTherefore\\n, \\nin our opinion, \\nthe ASC stands to capture a sizable windfall at the expense of small \\nbusinesses. \\n \\n \\nRelated to this\\n, C\\nongress granted the authorization of AMC Registry fees on the presumption of the \\ndevelopment of \\na grant program to state appraiser regulatory agencies. To date, \\nthe ASC has chosen not \\nto develop such a program\\n. I\\nnstead\\n, the ASC has chosen \\nt\\no \\nprovide those grant funds to \\nThe \\nAppraisal \\nFoundation \\nfor the \\npurpose of developing \\ncourses for state appraisa\\nl board investigators\\n3\\n. It is our view \\n\\n \\n \\nWe note that the \\n\\n2015 \\nAnnual Report indicates exploring other options, including additional course\\n \\ndevelopment for state appraiser\\n \\nregulatory agencies\\n\\n. This \\ncontinues to \\nignore the clear mandate \\nfrom the Dodd\\n-\\nFrank Act to provide \\ndirect \\ngrant funding to state appraiser regulatory agencies. \\nThe \\nproposed rule also includes vague reference to funding \\nfrom this proposal being \\nused to support existing \\n \\n \\n \\n                                        \\n                  \\n \\n3\\n \\nOn September 11, 2013, the ASC adopted a \\nState Grant Policy\\n\\nadministered through the Appraisal Foundation grant are considered a g\\nrant to the States as the courses benefit State personnel\\n\\n\\n\\ntems, \\n\\n \\nFrom the Appraisal Subcommittee Open\\n \\nSession Meeting Minutes, September 13, 2013\\n,\\n \\navailable at \\nhttps://www.asc.gov/Documents/MeetingMinutes/09.11.13%20\\n-\\n%20Open%20Minutes.pdf\\n  \\nSee also, ASC State Gr\\nant Policy, \\navailable at \\nhttps://www.appraisalinstitute.org/assets/1/29/asc_state_grant_policy_9_11_13.pdf\\n \\n \\nCollection and Transmission of Annual Appraisal Management Company Registry Fees\\n \\nJuly 1\\n5\\n, 2016 \\n \\n \\n3\\n \\n \\n \\nASC programs and Title XI activities\\n4\\n.

       "  'July 15, 2016 James Park, Executive Director Appraisal Subcommittee 1401 H St NW, Suite760 Washington, DC 2005 RE: Docket No. AS16-06 r:1 DWeLL WORKS® www dwel works com We respectfully submit the following comments and concerns relating to the Proposed Rule issued by the Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC) which would implement the collection and transmission of appraisal management company (AMC) annual registry fees. The implementation of a national registry of AMCs appears to be a good idea on the surface. However, we believe this will negatively affect AMCs (disproportionately so for smaller AMCs ), consumers and real estate appraisers due to the following effects of this regulation: Ł Individual States will be burdened with yet another administrative task I procedure which could result in additional State fees for AMCs, on top of the current licensing, registration and administration fees already imposed by States; Ł AMCs would most likely have to consider passing the additional cost of these Federal and State fees to their clients, who in turn would pass to consumers; Ł AMCs would be required to pay the $25.00 registry fee for each appraiser who performed an appraisal for the AMC in every State in which the AMC is licensed I registered -this could potentially motivate AMCs to work with a fewer number of appraisers in each State, further driving appraisers out \\nof the profession; Ł The Proposed Rule does not state that the $25.00 registry should not be passed down to real estate appraisers; therefore, AMCs could attempt to require appraisers to pay the registry fee, further driving appraisers out of the profession; Ł Although the option selected by the ASC is intended to impose the least burden on AMCs, we believe it will ultimately be anti-competitive and will hurt the smaller AMCs more than the larger companies. For example, a small, national AMC may use 3,000 appraisers to process 15,000 appraisals (ratio of five appraisals by each appraiser and total cost of $75k on roughly $6.375M in revenue. The ratio of revenue to cost is 85x). A larger AMC may use 4,000 appraisers to produce 30,000 appraisals (ratio of 7.5 appraisals by each appraiser and a total cost of $1 OOk on 12. 75M in revenue. The ratio of revenue to cost is 127x). The ratio of cost compared to revenue will be disproportionately higher for a smaller, national AMC compared to a larger, national AMC. This will further drive consolidation within the appraisal industry to the largest of institutions which we believe to be counterintuitive to the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act. Integrity+ Teamwork Performance+ Innovation + Fun rn DWeLL WORKS® Finally, we recognize that this rule is being proposed \"pursuant to authority granted in the Dodd-Frank Act\". However, it is unclear how the implementation of a National Registry of AMCs is beneficial to the consumer or industry as a whole. It seems, given the points stated above, that the only benefit to having a national registry is a monetary benefit. For what will the $25 fee be used, once the registry is created and fully functional, and how will that improve the appraisal process and profession? Thank you for considering the information stated above and for allowing us the opportunity to present our comments and concerns relating to the proposed rule.

The \\nmultiplier in this o\\nption would include all appraisers on an AMC panel, including those \\nappraisers accepted by the AMC for consideration for future appraisal assignments.\\n \\n \\n\\nappraisers \\nengaged by the AMC to perform an appraisal \\non a covered transaction during the \\nreporting period in a particular State.  The appraiser would be considered in the calculation for \\nthe purpose of AMC \\nRegistry fees\\n \\nat the time an AMC engaged the appraiser to pe\\nrform a \\nparticular appraisal assignment, regardless of whether the appraisal was fully performed during \\nthe reporting period.\\n \\n \\n\\ninterpreted to include appraisers tha\\nt performed an appraisal for the AMC on a covered \\ntransaction during the reporting period in a particular State.  This option would exclude \\nappraisers accepted by the AMC for consideration for future appraisal assignments, as well as \\nappraisers who perform\\ned appraisals in the past, but did not perform any appraisals in the \\nreporting period.\\n \\n \\nThe ASC chose the interpretation described under OPTION 3 because \\nthe ASC believes this \\noption \\nwould result in the collection of the lowest aggregate fee\\n \\nallowed under \\nthe statut\\ne and, \\ntherefore, would impose the lowest financial burden on an AMC.\\n \\n \\nTALCB \\nopposes\\n \\n\\n\\n \\nState appraiser \\nregulatory agencies to implement and validate.\\n  \\nTitle XI, as amended by the \\nDodd\\n-\\nFrank\\n \\nAct, already \\nrequires State appraiser regulatory agencies who elect to register AMCs in their State to determine the \\n\\npanel.  In fact, the number of appraisers on an AMC\\n\\ns panel is \\nthe criteria that determines whether an AMC must register in a particular State.  Thus, the interpretation \\nunder OPTION 1 would be the easiest interpretation for State appraiser regulatory agen\\ncies to \\n\\nState during the reporting period would already be known and reported to a State because that is the \\nsame \\ncriteria used to determine whether the AMC\\n \\nmust register with the State in the first instance.\\n \\n \\n\\nand accurately self\\n-\\nreport the number of appraisers falling within the proposed interpretation because \\nnothi\\nng in Title XI, as amended by the \\nDodd\\n-\\nFrank\\n \\nAct, or the AMC Rules adopted by the Federal \\nFinancial Institutions Examination Council in 2015 utilizes the interpretation proposed by the ASC to \\n \\nJuly 1\\n8\\n, 2016\\n \\nT\\nALCB Comments \\n-\\n \\nASC Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\\n \\nAMC National Registry Fee\\n \\nPage \\n3\\n \\nof 8\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nitle XI or the AMC Rules \\ncurrently \\nrequire State appraiser regulatory agencies to collect or track the information necessary to identify \\nwhich appraisers on an AMC panel would fall within this proposed interpretation.\\n  \\n \\n \\nAccordingly, State appraiser regula\\ntory agencies would be required to audit an AMC on a \\nperiodic basis to validate this data as self\\n-\\nreported by an AMC.  To validate the data self\\n-\\nreported by an \\nAMC, such an audit would need to look at more\\n \\nextensive\\n \\ninformation than simply the number of \\nap\\npraisers on an AMC panel during the reporting period.  When one considers the potential cost\\ns\\n \\nof \\nsuch \\nadditional \\naudits to both State appraiser regulatory agencies and AMCs, \\nthere is no evidence that \\nthis interpretation \\nwould actually\\n \\nimpose the lowest fin\\nancial burden on an AMC\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\nBecause Title XI, as amended by the \\nDodd\\n-\\nFrank\\n \\nAct, already requires both AMCs and State \\nappraiser regulatory authorities to collect and track the number of appraisers on an AMC panel to \\ndetermine whether an AMC must register \\nwit\\nh a \\nS\\ntate \\nin the first instance, OPTION 1 would be a better \\ninterpretation for the ASC to use \\nfor\\n \\n\\nT\\nhis information is \\nalready known and tracked by AMCs and many State appraiser regulatory authorities who have \\nalready \\nelected to register AMCs.  Moreover, t\\no the extent \\nthis information would require validation, an AMC \\ncould provide a simple report to State appraiser regulatory agencies identifying those appraisers on the \\n\\nhereby significantly reducing potential audit costs to an AMC \\nand the State appraiser regulatory agency that would be required to validate th\\nis singl\\ne data\\n \\npoint\\n.\\n \\n \\nAdditionally, an AMC would be able to control and manage the financial burden of AMC \\nRegistr\\ny \\nfees\\n \\nin the same manner that it controls and manages the number of appraisers on its panel.\\n \\n \\nFor these reasons, TALCB urges the ASC to \\nadopt\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\nQuestion 3:\\n  \\nThe ASC request\\n\\n\\nthose appraisers that performed an appraisal for the AMC during the reporting per\\niod, the second \\n\\nan appraisal, regardless of whether the appraiser completed the appraisal during the reporting period.  \\nThe ASC is requesting comment on w\\nhether this would be an easier interpretation for the States to \\nadminister.\\n \\n \\nTALCB \\nComments in response to Question 3:\\n \\n \\nTh\\ne\\n \\ninterpretation \\n\\nunder \\nOPTION 2\\n \\nas described \\nabove and \\nin the co\\nmmentary to the proposed rule \\nwould not be easier for \\nTALCB\\n \\nor other State appraiser regulatory agencies to \\nimplement and administer.  \\nLike the \\ninterpretation chosen by the ASC under OPTION 3, the interpretation under OPTION 2 creates a new \\nregulatory crit\\neria for State appraiser regulatory areas to implement and validate.

First, as an appraiser, I am on the State appraisal list and the national registry, and I cannot fathom why each AMC should pay $25 to have me on their panel. lfl am on 10 panels, why should the State or the Foundation be paid $250 for me when I am already licensed. I am opposed to the idea and other than more taxes, its a bad idea. Secondly, if you must charge this tax on a tax, I do not want to pay triple. It must be made clear in the rulemaking that AMC's should not be allowed to directly or indirectly require any appraiser to pay a surcharge for the cost to operate the AMC. Help to protect the consumer and increase appraiser's independence by making it very clear that registry fees which are all part of the cost of doing business should not be passed down to appraisers. Real estate appraisers should receive the entire customary and reasonable fee, one that is not eroded by the operating cost of management companies. I have been appraising for 33 years, I have been licensed and pay for my license, and I do not believe that I should be required to pay each AMC a fee to be on their panel. I have already dropped several AMC organizations who charge me fees. I hear a complaint among some AMCs who have problems finding qualified appraisers, and we are getting fewer in numbers. Appraisers are perhaps a necessary evil, you need them to be independent and qualified to help protect the banking system. I do not think paying an AMC to be on their panel helps with independence. I do not plan on paying to be on an AMC panel and I hope that you will direct the regulation telling the AMCs that they may not charge to include me on their panel. Thank you William Fitzhugh Turner.

Street N.W., Suite 760 Washington, D.C. 20005 Sent via email only: webmaster@asc.gov RE: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Docket No. AS16-06 Dear Ms. Schuster: CoesterVMS 7529 Standish Place, Suite 200 Rockville, MD 20855 Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments. CoesterVMS is not a state regulatory body, yet it seems fitting that one being subjected to the regulation would also comment. We have intentionally not answered Questions 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Question 1: The ASC requests comment on all aspects of the proposed annual AMC registry fee. Response: It appears that the ASC has a difficult task based on the statutory language and the authority that they have in Title XI. It is unfortunate that this legislation does not recognize the difference in the regulation of corporations and that of the individual appraisers. Some difficulties for an AMC: Ł What is a covered vs. non-covered transaction? Until this has been clearly defined, it will make the tracking and reporting of all required information rather confusing. If the states do not clearly know the interpretation of what is a covered and non-covered transaction, the AMCs that are regulated cannot fairly and accurately report the required information . . I www.coestervms.com Ł 888.485.1999 >\\'4> Valuation Management Servic.es Ł The staggered renewal dates and the ability to promptly renew or submit an early renewal for every state complicates the reporting process which may unintentionally impede the accuracy of the process. Ł An AMC could unintentionally misrepresent the number of appraisers on their panel IF they are required to submit this information with their state renewal. Some states require an early application submission prior to the expiration date. How can a company have a timely renewal submitted 30 days early with an accurate appraiser count? It is impossible for a company to accurately forecast an appraiser panel. We would kindly offer the suggestion that the reporting period be the same for every state but the fee be collected at the time of renewal. Another solution would be to allow an AMC to complete the renewal process at one point with the panel information reported either after renewal, with a separate fee collected, or with a different reporting time period. Some states now struggle with timely renewals without the additional burden of more data collection. Ł The estimated time for each state\\'s implementation and regulation was 500 hours. The burden on each company to maintain these records leaves a concern that the reporting requirements will become a cumbersome responsibility on both the state and the AMCs. Ł AMC registration has been seen as the financial answer for some state boards. With the upcoming compliance requirements, there is concern that some states will raise AMC fees and create additional panel fees to assist in dealing with their new responsibilities. While this is a cost of business, we ask the ASC to minimize the additional reporting requirements and assure the states will receive the needed grants to cover these costs. Question 2: The ASC requests comment on the ASC\\'s interpretation of the phrase \"working for or contracting with.\" Response: We believe that this is the least economic impact upfront for an AMC. As stated above, the largest concern is timing the reporting in conjunction with the renewal submission. Question 3: The ASC requests comment on the second option\\'s interpretation of the phrase \"working for or contracting with.\" While the proposal defines \"working for or contracting with\" to include only those appraisers that performed an appraisal for the AMC during the reporting period, the second option would define \"working for or contracting with\" to mean \"the AMC engaged an appraiser to perform an appraisal, regardless of whether the appraiser completed the appraisal during the reporting period.\" ,_..;;!Ł l\"i-, I www.coestervms.com Ł 888.485.1999 , } \\'\\' --Valuation Management Services Response: Many AMCs would be forced to take a serious look at their appraisal panels and be forced to trim their panel sizes due to not only the financial impact but also the record keeping. AMCs that are following frugal business practices or are financially weak would minimize all appraiser panels, removing as many appraisers as possible. This could have a negative impact in certain markets creating slower appraisal turn times and far fewer used appraisers which could diminish the quality of the loan process. If you have follow-up questions, I\\'d be happy to answer those. I also offer any assistance that I may be in the future.

The gathering of information and enforcement \\n by a State Board would essentially be impossible as the Board would have to assume any \\nreport provided to them by the AMC is accurate. \\n  \\nOption Two\\n The WCREAB believes Option Two\\n could \\npenalize AMC\\ns for accepting an order from a \\nclient and placing that ord\\ner with an appraiser when the appraisal is later cancelled and \\n\\nthe AMC\\n and/\\nor \\nthe \\nappraiser receive no compensation for that order. \\nOption Two would \\nalso be very \\ndifficult to enf\\norce as a State regulatory board\\n without extensive reporting \\nfrom both\\n AMCs\\n and appraisers on the status of assignments and their completion during \\na given time frame. \\n  \\nOption Three\\n The WCREAB considers\\n Option \\nThree to be the \\nmost logical\\n model to adopt for the \\ncollection of AMC registry fees because this model is based on whether \\nor not\\n compensation has been earned by all parti\\nes.  This option simplifies the queries that State\\n regulatory boards\\n would need to run to\\n report all\\n registered \\nAMCs\\n that \\nhave completed \\nappraisal rep\\norts during a specific year or time frame. \\n  \\nAdministrativ\\ne Costs\\n Our agency has conducted an assessment of the costs related to collection of an AMC fee.  \\n\\nThe WCREAB estimates that this will require twenty\\n-five (25) hours per month of staff \\ntime to complete.  We know that this will require completion of a projec\\nt with our \\nlicensing software provider, and that costs approximately $6,000.  Staff time equates to \\n\\nroughly $700 per month.  \\n \\n \\nThank you for the opportunity to comment.

Appraisers\\n are well \\naware\\n of this\\n as AMCs require upload fees, b\\nackground check fees, panel fees, etc. if appraiser\\ns wish\\n to do business with them.\\n In a normal\\n open\\n market, such fees and costs would be market controlled.  Unfortunately, as Don \\nKelly, spokesperson for the Real Estate Valuation Advocacy Association (REVA\\nA), mentioned \\nin his testimony to Congress in 2012, ﬁnearly 70% of all residential appraisals ordered and \\nproduced nationwide are provided through an AMC.ﬂ\\n  \\nThis monopoly on available \\nresidential mortgage appraisal assignments by AMCs\\n, put them in a \\nunique\\nly dominant position over appraisers and consumers.\\n  It is not an ﬁopenﬂ market.  On the \\ncontrary, it is quite controlled.\\n \\n \\nIn addition, the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), in their June 2014 letter to \\nfederal \\nagencies on proposed minimum requirements \\nfor AMCs mention, ﬁ–AMCs offer ﬁfee certaintyﬂ \\n\\nﬁ... AMCs normalize fees at a local level, typically by quoting county level pricing to lenders. \\nConsumer pricing in turn is based on AMCs™ ability to average their underlying service costs \\n(including individu\\nal fee appraiser charges) across a large number of engagements.ﬂ\\n   http://www.ncreaa.org/\\n Page\\n 2 | 2   AMCs™ control over fees and costs associated with not only ordering\\n an appraisal (which is\\n, in \\nfact\\n, their only unique ability when it comes to regulatory compliance) but\\n the entire appraisa\\nl process \\nin general, has been an enormous concern.  The inclusion of AMCs into the mortgage \\n\\nand appraisal process has commoditized the ordering of an appraisal and has taken the emphasis \\n\\noff of the purpose of an appraisal and its priority as a lender and \\ncreditor protection.\\n   \\n \\nAMCs have also referred\\n in the past\\n to the passing of costs resulting from regulatory \\nburdens on \\ntheir business processes,\\n onto consumers.  In a June 2014 comment letter to Federal agencies \\n\\nregarding proposed minimum requirements for AMCs, REVAA says, ﬁThe potential risk of \\n\\nconflicting interpretations over what a lender or AMC must pay an appraiser, for example, will \\n\\nresult i\\nn the passing of that risk to consumers by the way of higher fees.ﬂ\\n  \\nAppraisers have seen and experienced the penchant for AMCs to indemnify themselves and \\n\\nsidestep burdens that both their clients and appraisers have no choice but to bear.  From \\n\\nincluding \\nthe costs that they incur into\\n what is categorized as th\\ne ﬁappraisal feeﬂ on loan \\ndisclosures, \\nrequiring \\ncontractor agreements that prohibit independent appraisers from disclosing \\nor talking about the fees that are paid to them by the AMC, etc., have all c\\nreated confusion \\namong lenders and consumers as to what appraisers are being paid and what AMCs are\\n actually\\n charging.\\n  \\nWe ask that the ASC adopt rules that prohibit the practice of passing \\nany additional financial \\nburdens along to the working appraiser\\n as part of their acceptance of an assignment.  Again, \\nAMCs are unique\\n in that they admittedly control an enormous majority of the available appraisal \\nwork\\n.  Appraisers have the \\nunenviable\\n position of being cornered into accepting these \\nassignments and any fees or penalties associated with them.\\n  The appraiser can choose not to \\naccept AMC assignments\\n, but then\\n suffer the impact on their business by declining\\n the\\n source of \\n70% of residential\\n assignments.  As appraisers decline these assignments, we experience the \\nsame AMCs complaining of an ﬁappraiser shortageﬂ (An ASC report recently stated that there \\nare\\n actually\\n more credentialed appraisers on the national registry now than \\nthere was \\nin 20\\n06) \\nand clamoring for lowering appraiser qualification standards in order to flood less qualified and \\n\\nless experienced appraisers into the\\n profession in order\\n to accept the lower fee assignments.  A \\nvicious circle brought on by the overwhelming influence o\\nf the AMC business model.\\n  \\nThe appraiser has no ability to pass their costs onto the consumer, but the AMCs do.  The \\n\\nconsumer will be completely unaware, however, since every attempt to require AMCs to \\n\\nseparate their fees from the actual fee paid to the ap\\npraiser on loan disclosures\\n and by other \\nmeans\\n has \\nbeen fought and defeated.\\n  \\nIf appraisers are not protected\\n from th\\nis \\nadditional\\n burden\\n, the ability for the appraisal profession \\nto function and succeed as a livelihood will have yet another \\nhardship\\n to ab\\nsorb\\n and overcome\\n.   \\n \\nSincerely,\\n  \\nThe North Carolina Real Estate Appraiser Association\\n ',\n",

       "  'June 30, 2016\\n RE: Docket No. AS16\\n-06 To Whom It May Concern:\\n The following is offered regarding the above docket #: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to Implement \\nCollection and Transmission of Annual AMC Registry Fees:\\n I have been a real estate appraiser \\nsince 1986 and have been certified in three states over the years \\nsince licensing was implemented in 1992. Over the past 30 years I have worked in many capacities as an \\nappraiser including working for banks, appraisal fee shops and appraisal management com\\npanies.\\n While the notice has attempted to differentiate between appraisal management companies and other \\nproviders of appraisal services, \\nit is my contention \\nthe\\nse proposed\\n ﬁregistry feesﬂ should be applied to \\nall providers of appraisal services. The notic\\ne states ﬁIf an appraisal firm hires independent contractors it \\nshould be considered both an appraisal firm and an AMC. As such the hybrid entity would be treated as \\nan AMC for purposes of state registration if it meets the statutory panel size\\n threshold (\\noverseeing more \\nthan 15 appraisers) that are independent contractors.ﬂ  It has been my experience that a large \\npercentage of appraisal firms hire appraisers as independent contractors and not as employees. These \\n\\ncontracted appraisers receive no employee be\\nnefits such as health insurance or 401k. They receive a \\n1099 at the end of each year for services rendered. In a further attempt to separate the function of \\n\\nﬁappraisal firmsﬂ and appraisal management companies, the notice goes on to state ﬁAppraisal firms \\ndo \\n\\nnot oversee networks or panels of non\\n-employee appraisers.ﬂ  The notice provides absolutely no \\nevidence to support this contention. In fact the majority of ﬁappraisal firmsﬂ which are often referred to \\nas ﬁfee shopsﬂ in fact do just that \\nŒ they hire app\\nraisers on a ﬁper jobﬂ basis when they happen to have \\nwork in that person™s area and pay them on a piece work basis as jobs arise. The fee shop has no \\nexpenses associated with hiring an employee such as health insurance, disability insurance, pensions or \\n401k, etc. The fee shop has no expenses regarding providing a work space for this contracted appraiser \\nincluding rent, heat and electricity.\\n A key advantage of hiring an appraisal management company to provide appraisal services can be \\n\\nsummed up in one word\\n: quality.  The reputable appraisal management companies that are currently \\nproviding appraisal services \\nfunction primarily as educators of field appraisers. AMCs hire certified \\n\\nappraisers to perform the quality control function that ensures all appraisal \\nreports conform to the \\n\\nUniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice as well as to appraisal theory and client \\n\\nrequirements. These AMC employees are provided employees benefits such as health insurance, etc. \\n\\nwhich increase the cost of doing business\\n but ensure the provision of a quality product to the Intended \\nUser. As the field appraisers work increasingly with AMCs the abilities of the field appraisers are \\n\\nenhanced, the conformance of the product is standardized in ways that UAD and CU have been un\\nable \\nto adequately accomplish and the client is provided with an appraisal report that they need and \\n\\nunderstand.\\n In summary, AMCs are providing an important service to the lending industry and should not be \\npenalized above and beyond other providers of app\\nraiser services.\\n Christine Geering\\n Cegeering\\n@yahoo.com\\n     ',\n",

Our rationale is that the first and second options will lead to \\na\\nppraisal \\nm\\nanagement \\nc\\n\\ndue to lack of current volume in a particular service area in order to reduce the amount \\nof fees paid to the ASC.  When volume in a particular market are increases, th\\ne AMC \\nwould then be required to re qualify the same appraisers that we\\nre\\n \\nformerly part of \\ntheir fee panel\\n \\n-\\n \\nincluding but not limited to the examination of demonstration reports, \\nexamination of education and experience, and the completion of a background che\\nck.  \\nWe envision a scenario in which a significant delay\\n \\noccurs\\n \\nin the production of \\ncompleted appraisals due to the above requirement \\n\\n \\nwhich in turn could have an \\nadverse effect on the underlying real estate market.  \\n \\n \\nIn short, the third option will best allow\\n \\nthe current AMC / \\nf\\nee \\np\\nanel system to scale up \\nand down with the demands of the market for a particular area thus allowing the \\nsystem to be elastic, meet the needs of the banking community and the public, and \\nreduce unnecessary costs to industry participa\\n\\nindividual appraisers.\\n \\n \\n \\nCPREA Letter to ASC\\n \\nJuly 15, 2016\\n \\nPage \\n-\\n \\n2\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPromoting Responsible Real Estate Valuation\\n\\n \\n \\n2.\\n \\nIt is clear that a significant sum of money will be generated by the \\nP\\nroposed \\nR\\nules.  It is \\nour understanding that Congress intended for the funds generated to be used by the \\nASC for grants to t\\nhe individual state regulatory agencies for both education and \\nenforcement.  The Proposed Rules show no plan for grants to the states.  We \\n\\ngrants prior to approval and i\\nmplementation.\\n \\n \\n3.\\n \\nWe believe that the administrative burden on the state regulatory agencies shown \\nunder the heading State Reporting Burden on Page 31871 of the Federal Register is \\nvastly understated and that each regulatory agency \\nwill \\nspend as many as 500 hours in \\ncompliance with the collection and transmission process.  Conversations with the \\nregulatory a\\ngency in Pennsylvania indicate that that our concern is correct, and it is our \\nunderstanding that the regulatory agency will be commenting more fully on that issue. \\nWe believe that the state regulatory agencies should be reimbursed for their actual \\nexpense\\ns in collecting and transmitting the fees or that a flat fee per appraiser should be \\npaid to the state regulatory agencies (i.e. $5.00 of each $25.00 fee collected by the \\nregulatory agency would be retained by the regulatory agency to offset the cost of \\nco\\nllection and transmission).  Without such fees, the amount of funds that the state \\nregulatory agencies will be able to allocate to \\nadministration \\nand enforcement will be \\ndecreased due to budgetary pressures at the state government level.\\n \\n \\n4.\\n \\nWe believe that the\\n\\n$25.00 fee per appraiser onto the individual appraiser, thereby having the unintended \\nconsequence of placing an additional financial burden on our members.  As an example \\none of our me\\nmbers recently indicated that their firm of two appraisers was a member \\nof 63 fee panels \\n\\n \\nwhich would translate into that firm being forced to pay $3,150 in \\nfees to remain on those panels unless the Proposed Rules are modified.

Schuster From: Sent: To: Subject: Weaver, Brian <Brian.Weaver@illinois.gov> Friday, July 1 5, 201 6 12:1 3 \\nPM webmaster@asc.gov Docket AS1 6-06 Rather than attempt to answer the eight questions from the ASC, we need clarity on the mechanics of the transmission of fees and how AMCs will be processed. Because there are and will be AMCs that are above and below the threshold of the 16/25 minimum, Illinois will need a two-tiered system. In participating States, the minimum requirements apply to any AMC that provides appraisal management services, as defined in the final rule, and meets the statutory panel size threshold, which is that the AMC oversees an appraiser panel of more than 15 State certified or State-licensed appraisers in a State or 25 or !!1!l!£ appraisers in two or more States in a calendar year or 12-month period under State law. States may establish requirements for AMC registration and supervision that are in addition to these minimum requirements. How will we know when or if a below threshold AMC becomes an at or above threshold AMC? There is no benefit for self-reporting so we will need to audit the below threshold AMCs on a regular basis. Scenario 1: An AMC has 10 state certified Illinois appraisers on its roster, only. It remains a below the threshold AMC. Scenario 2: An AMC has 10 state certified Illinois appraisers on its roster and has 6 state certified appraisers in Indiana. It must register as an at or above the threshold AMC. Scenario 3: An AMC has 10 state certified Illinois appraisers on its roster and has 6 state certified appraisers in Indiana. However, Indiana has opted not to register AMCs. What is our responsibility? Is the AMC a below threshold AMC or an at or above threshold AMC? By what method, and when would we remit fees to the ASC under the proposed rule? The proposed rule would require AMC registry fees to be collected and transmitted to the ASC on an annual basis by States that elect to register and supervise AMCs. Only those AMCs whose registry fees have been transmitted to the ASC would be eligible to be on the AMC Registry for the 12-month period following the payment of the fee. Scenario 4: AMC submits to Illinois, a roster of 100 state certified appraisers in total. Of that, 63 have completed a covered transaction in the previous twelve months. The AMC owes $1,575 in fees to be transmitted to the ASC. Even if the previous 12 months went January 1 to December 31, we couldn\\'t possibly vet the information and bill the AMC in time to make the required payment for the next January 1. What is the timeline that the ASC is considering between verification and remittance? 1 Scenario 5: AMC submits to Illinois, a roster of 100 state certified appraisers in total. Of that, 63 have completed a covered transaction in the previous twelve months. The AMC owes $1,575 in fees to be transmitted to the ASC. A month later the AMC wants to amend the count to reflect 59; not 63 appraisers. Do we still collect $1,575? What if we\\'ve already transmitted this money to the ASC? Will the ASC refund $100 back to us so we can refund it back to the AMC? If not, will we \"eat\" the $100? We have one AMC that has over 66,000 appraisers on their nationwide panel. If only 40,000 of them did one covered transaction in the previous 12 months, that would equal $1,000,000 in fees to be forwarded to the ASC each year and every year. However, because this entity is registered in every jurisdiction that has a program, which state needs to transmit those funds? One? All of the jurisdictions from \\nwhich this AMC operates? Is each state to transmit fees to the ASC equal to the number of certified and licensed appraisers ONLY in that state, or inclusive of the entire panel nationwide? If every jurisdiction is auditing their AMCs at different times of the year, audits will be continuous and both the AMCs and the states will need to staff up for perpetual auditing. This will add costs and inevitably need to be reflected in every state\\'s fee structure. Scenario 6: An AMC is purchased, mid-year, by a new AMC entity. The purchased entity is dissolved and all of the appraisers from the old entity are now contracted by the new entity. Does the new entity\\'s Registry fee include work completed by the panel prior to purchase? Is there an exception? What if the old entity reorganizes from an LLC to an LLP? Is it a new entity? Scenario 7: A Large AMC has 500 appraisers nationwide who have completed a covered transaction in the previous twelve months. 100 are in Illinois. 100 are in Indiana. The rest, 300, are spread out over 25 other states and never exceed 15 in any single state. What is the amount to be transmitted by Illinois? Currently, regarding appraisers on the National Registry, payment must be received by the ASC within 45 days of invoice or appraisers risk becoming \"inactive\". These invoices come every month. Will this be the same protocol for AMC National Registry payments? If not, what is the anticipated cycle? These are just some of the issues we are forced to consider in order to craft meaningful legislation.

The CRN represents every stakeholder in the valuation arena therefore; CRN \\ncomment letters are not intended to speak for all members as with each issue, stakeholders often have \\ndiverse opinions.  The CRN position\\n is to highlight the various viewpoints and work towards holistic \\nsolutions that are best for the entire profession.\\n  Background\\n  The Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC) of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) \\nis proposing a rule pursuan\\nt to authority granted in the Dodd\\n-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \\nProtection Act (Dodd\\n-Frank Act) to implement collection and transmission of appraisal management \\ncompany (AMC) annual registry fees by State appraiser certifying and licensing agencie\\ns that elect to \\nregister and supervise AMCs. \\n  This proposed rule would set the annual AMC registry fee that States would collect and transmit to the \\nASC if they elect to register and supervise AMCs.  This proposed rule also sets forth the ASCÕs \\ninterpreta\\ntion of the phrase Òworking for or contracting withÓ as used in the calculation of annual AMC \\nregistry fees in accordance with section 1109 as amended by the Dodd\\n-Frank Act.\\n  CRN Comments\\n   Under the direction of the CRN AMC Committee Chair Michael Simmons\\n and Vice Chair Frank \\nGuarnera a short survey was developed and sent to the CRN AMC committee members soliciting their \\nperspectives.

Through this dialogue the committee will develop industry \\nsolutions in support of the valuation industry.  Highlights of the survey follow:\\n  Interpreting the Phrase ÒWorking \\nFor or Contracting \\nWithÓ\\n  The ASC consi\\ndered three options with respect to interpreting the phrase Òworking for or contracting \\nwithÓ.  An overview of the responses reveals that 85.71 percent of the committee was in favor of the \\nASCÕs third option, which would include appraisers that performed an\\n appraisal for the AMC on a \\ncovered transaction during the reporting period in a particular State.  Supporting the first option was \\n9.52 percent and 4.76 percent supported the second option.\\n  Additional Clarity Regarding Collection and Transmission of Annu\\nal AMC Fees \\n  The proposed rule would require AMC registry fees to be collected and transmitted to the ASC on an \\nannual basis by States that elect to register and supervise AMCs.  Only those AMCs whose registry \\nfees have been transmitted to the ASC would b\\ne eligible to be on the AMC Registry for the 12\\n-month \\nperiod following the payment of the fee.  Under the proposed rule, the states would have flexibility to \\nalign a one\\n-year period with any 12\\n-month period, which may or may not be based on the calendar \\nyear.  Many states do not use a calendar year for their existing appraiser credentialing process.  For \\nexample, some States have a date certain every year and some States use the appraiserÕs date of \\nbirth. Because AMCÕs fees must be transmitted to the ASC by\\n the state and the proposed flexibility \\nthere could be potential issues with the timing of payment of fees and the actual transmission of the \\nfees.\\n  The AMC Committee was nearly unanimous (95.24 percent) in expressing concerns that the proposed \\nrule does n\\not clearly address potential timing gaps and recommends that the final rule adds additional \\nlanguage that clearly addresses these potential gaps in order to avoid any unintended consequences.  \\n  Establishing AMC Registration Fees for AMCs in Existence Less\\n Than One Year\\n  The \\nASCÕs Question 2\\n, in the proposed rule,\\n states that in the case of an AMC that has not been in \\nexistence for more than a year, $25 registry fees would be established by multiplying the number of \\nappraisers who have performed an appraisal for the AMC on a covered \\ntransaction in such State since \\nthe AMC commenced doing business.  Performance of an appraisal means the appraisal service \\nrequested of an appraiser by the AMC was provided to the AMC.  If the AMC is a new entrant \\ndetermining how many appraisals the apprai\\nser in the State has done could be difficult and become an \\nunintended consequence.\\n  The AMC Committee felt the proposed rule requires additional clarity on how an AMC that has been in \\n   Collateral Risk Network\\n 12417 Ocean Gateway, Bldg B11, Suite 286, Ocean City, MD  21842\\n www.CollateralRiskNetwork.com\\n   CRNCollateral Risk Network RE:  CRN\\n AMC Committee\\n Comments \\n- ASC Proposed Rule AMC Registry Fees\\n July 19\\n, 2016\\n Page \\n3  business for less than a year fees are established.

Suite 760 \\n\\nWashington, D.C. 20005; \\n RE: Comments AS 16-06 \\nDear Subcommittee:  \\nI strongly suggest that this regulation be tabled and the ASC communicate to \\nCongress and ask that they amend this portion of Dodd-Frank (DF) to give the ASC \\nmore flexibility for the following reasons: \\n1. The proposed fee collects far more aggregate money than Congress ever \\nanticipated. \\n2. There is no provision or plan that \\nhas been introduced of how and where \\nthis money will be spent. \\n3. It adds to the increasing appraisal fees that consumers have to pay for \\nappraisals. \\n4. AMC™s are already paying registration \\nfees to the states and a registry fee \\nmore in line with those paid by appraisers would be more reasonable, \\nespecially when one considers points 1, 2, and 3.  \\n Point 1 \\nAs I understand it, DF mandates a minimum $25 fee per appraiser per AMC \\n\\n(maximum $50) Œ it is not discretionary  - to be collected by those states who regulate \\nAMC™s.  In order to estimate the total fees \\nthat would be collected under this rule, I \\nused data from Kentucky and performed a quick ﬁback of the envelopeﬂ calculation.  \\nThere are 123 AMC™s regi\\nstered in KY.  Based upon pre\\nliminary reports to the KY Real \\nEstate Appraisers Board (KREAB), the averag\\ne AMC has some 50 appraisers on their \\nroster (some have as many 260). A reasonable projection then would be that Kentucky \\nwill collect approximately $153,750 (123 AM\\nC™s X 50 appraisers X $25/appraiser) to \\nforward on to the ASC. \\n222 Union StreetMadisonville, KY  42431 \\nP: 800-227-4708 | F: 270-821-0202Pritchett comments on AS 160-06  Page 3 \\n To further extrapolate, according to the 2015 ASC annual report there were some \\n98,351 appraiser certificate holders nationwide.   At last report Kentucky had some \\n1,505 certificate holders or 1.53% of the total appraisers in the country and 38 of the \\n52 jurisdictions have implemented AMC legi\\nslation (according to the Appraisal \\nInstitute).  Accordingly my ﬁback of the envelopeﬂ calculation returns an estimated \\nrevenue to the ASC as follows: \\n$153,750 ÷ 0.0153 X (38/52) = \\n$7,345,000 (rounded) \\n \\nAccording again to the 2015 ASC annu\\nal report, the 2015 ASC revenue was \\n$3,576,000.  Hence this new fee would more than double your existing annual budget.  \\nI™m sure that some additional work will be n\\needed on your part to collect this fee but \\nmost of the work will accrue to the st\\nates, who will receive none of the money. \\n  Hence I™m sure that Congress when they passed this complex bill (DF) had no idea of \\nthe total fiscal impact of this $25 fee in the total scheme of things. \\nPoint 2  \\nThere has been no public information of wh\\nich I am aware of where this money will be \\nspent.  Referring again to the ASC annual report, the net position of the ASC is some \\n$4.691million or more than 1 year of expe\\nnses - so the ASC has sufficient reserves.   \\nTotal grants have been running some $600,000 per year and it is entirely probable \\n\\nthat the ASC will not have to employ significant additional resources as most of the \\ncollection work will be handled by the st\\nates.   But even if one assumes that 2 \\nadditional staff will be needed at $150,000 \\nin total personnel costs per staff person \\n(based upon figures from the ASC annual re\\nport), this still leaves over $7,000,000 in \\nnew revenues.  \\nThat is over 10 times the money now being paying out for grants.\\n So where is all this additional money going to go Œ and more importantly under \\nsequestration will you even be able to spend it? \\nPoint 3 \\nThe proliferation of AMC™s has contributed\\n to increased appraisal costs to the \\nconsumer.  AMC™s charge a fee over and abo\\nve the appraisal fee, which is then passed \\non to the consumer.  To maintain their pr\\nofitability they will either have to pass this \\nfee on or charge their appraisers a registry\\n fee Œ both raising appraisal costs to the \\nconsumer.   \\n  Pritchett comments on AS 160-06  Page 3 \\n Point 4  \\nGiven the aforementioned points, it would be\\n reasonable to ask Congress to amend the \\nlaw to the ASC the flexibility to charge a \\nnominal per AMC registry fee Œ not a per \\nappraiser registry fee.     \\nRespectfully submitted, \\n G.

ARTMAN, MEMBER BETTY J. CAGLE, MEMBER On behalf of the Oklahoma Real Estate Appraiser Board (the \"Board\"), I respectfully submit the following comments in response to the Appraisal Subcommittee\\'s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to Implement Collection and Transmission of Annual AMC Registry Fees at Docket #A$16-06. Question 1: Overall, the Board does not know how this issue could have been made any more complicated than it has been through the Proposed Rules as drafted and submitted for public comment. Why is the Appraisal Subcommittee (\"ASC\") simply not charging a flat fee across the board in lieu of the various \"if this, than that\" formulas? With appraisers, there is a flat $40.00 charge per appraiser per year to be listed on the Appraiser National Registry. By way of contrast, if we as the Board applied your ASC proposed formula for AMCs on the appraisers, we would be calculating how many appraisals were performed for how many different appraisal management companies (\"AMC\") in the past year. Not only does this not make sense, it is completely irrelevant to what the Board\\'s understanding is of the real purpose of the AMC National Registry which is \"information sharing\" rather than a mere generating vehicle for the ASC and a form of indentured servitude imposed upon the states through the AMC National Registry workload transfer from the ASC over to the states. While the assessment of the ASC\\'s fee is mandated in federal law in the fundamentally-flawed language of 12 U.S.C.§3338 that treats all AMCs the same including \"a subsidiary of a federally regulated financial institution\" which are not subject to any state registration or regulation, the AMC National Registry workload is not so Congressionally-mandated to be performed for the ASC by the states. This is the ASC\\'s invention. The ASC should follow the process provided for the Appraiser National Registry that allows the states to upload a data file to the ASC for inclusion on the national registry. The ASC should seek to change federal law in 12 U.S.C.§3338 (or otherwise), in order to collect its own fees and not burden the states with the duty to become the ASC\\'s collection agencies. Consistent with the ASC seeking to change the applicable federal law, ASC should withdraw these prematurely-issued Proposed Rules in the form presented until such time as the federal law is appropriately changed. E-MAIL: chrlstine.mcentlre@old.ok.gov WEBSITE: www.reab.old.ok.gov. (405) 521·6636 ·TOLL FREE (IN STATE) 1-800·522·0071 5 CORPORATE PLAZA, 3625 NW 56TH ST, STE 100, OKLAHOMA CITY, OK 73112 ·FAX: (405) 522·6909 Appraisal Subcommittee July 6, 2016 Under the federal definition, an appraisal management company with more than 15 appraisers on its panel must register in a state that has a state appraisal management registration program. Using the number 16 multiplied by the $25.00 registry fee charged the AMC per appraiser, the minimum amount to be collected from any AMC would amount to a $400.00. A more reasonable solution would be to charge a flat fee of $400.00 per AMC. With 127 AMCs registered in Oklahoma, at a $400.00 flat fee, the ASC would be collecting approximately $50,800.00 from Oklahoma alone. When you expand that $400.00 flat fee number to all of the states, or calculate the amount of money a single AMC registered in 10 states, or 20 states, may pay to be on the National Registry, the amount being charged becomes concerning. As an example, an AMC licensed in 20 states, at a flat rate of $400.00 would pay $8,000.00 to be listed on the AMC National Registry for one year. Why? The collection and processing of these fees is the same for an AMC with 16 appraisers in one state or an AMC with 20 appraisers in 25 states. Nothing changes and the workload is not increased in any manner that would justify such a large fee. It is also the Board\\'s understanding from the Proposed Rules that once the ASC has the AMC National Registry up and running, it will actually be the individual state jurisdictions that are to be solely responsible for entering and maintaining the information on the database through an extranet. From our standpoint, it appears that there is a complicated and unnecessary formula created to generate a great deal of income to the ASC and yet it is the individual state jurisdictions that are set to task in both collecting and transmitting the registry fees, and then doing the work to manually enter and update the data into the AMC National Registry. Question 2 and 3: If an appraiser is listed as being on an AMC\\'s panel, he or she is \"working for or contracting with/\\' an AMC. Asking for further breakdown of those appraisers who have completed an assignment or not, is requiring unnecessary additional work. There will be an ASC mandated unintended consequence that assignments will be given to fewer numbers of appraisers in \\norder to keep the list that requires accountability to the AMC National Registry artificially smaller. Question 4: The Board has concerns with a state trying to collect an unknown amount of money from an AMC, especially a federally regulated financial institution\\'s AMC over whom the state has no jurisdiction or other legal authority as to registration or regulation. Further, the Board is concerned as to how the ASC will invoice the state jurisdictions for payment of what is owed by the AMC when we as the Board have no information as to how many appraisers are on an AMC\\'s panel. Are you as the ASC simply going to take our word for the number of appraisers on an AMC\\'s panel after we as the Board simply take the AMC\\'s word for the number of such appraisers on its panel? While there has been some talk that state auditing of this information is not required by the ASC, there is no such language included in the Proposed Rules. Without someone performing such an audit periodically, however, everyone, ASC, AMC and the states, is really operating on the honor system. There is great potential for problems here, and the state jurisdictions have enough to do without creating situations to bring about additional enforcement actions when a flat fee as the Board has proposed herein, of $400.00 per AMC, would eliminate all of these concerns. Question 5: As a state agency the Board does not have, nor can it acquire through its own action or through the action of the Legislature of the State of Oklahoma, any lawful jurisdiction or legal authority, statutory or otherwise, to require that any federally regulated AMC or other federally regulated entity provide any information to the Board, or that any such federally regulated AMC or other federally regulated entity pay any kind of fee, ASC\\'s fees or otherwise, to the Board, or to collect money from, a any federally regulated AMC or other federally regulated entity. We as the Board have absolutely no 2 Appraisal Subcommittee July 6, 2016 recourse if a federally regulated AMC does not comply with any one or more of your requirements or refuses to even open or respond to any correspondence from the Board. The applicable federal law at 12 U.S.C.§3338 is fundamentally flawed as it provides that the states are to collect an annual registry fee from AMCs including \"a subsidiary of federally regulated financial institution\", entities that ASC knows or should know that the states have no authority to exercise any jurisdiction or authority over. Even should these entities submit this information to our state agency, the State of Oklahoma has no jurisdiction or legal authority to adopt any statutes that would authorize the Board to do anything further, and we as the Board have no authority to adopt any rules or regulations that would allow us to do anything further, including deposit their money and act as the pass through to transmit the fees to the ASC. In lieu of trying to get the state jurisdictions to adopt and implement statutes, rules and regulations to allow this to occur, it makes the most sense for the ASC to communicate directly with the federally-regulated AMC\\'s to collect the information and fees that it requires. The Board understands that such a course of action will require the ASC going back to Congress to correct the law applicable and that such process will take some time. The hands of the State of Oklahoma remain tied in this regard until ASC takes appropriate remedial action through the Congress to correct this fundamental flaw in 12 U.S.C.§3338 and gives the states actual jurisdiction over federally regulated entities, if that is what the ASC desires. For this reason, the issuance of the Proposed Rules in the form presented by the ASC is premature and the Proposed Rules should be withdrawn until federal law at 12 U.S.C.§3338 is amended appropriately. Question 6: Oklahoma has authority through its promulgated rules at Oklahoma Administrative Code (OAC) 600:30-1-6 to collect a national registry fee from an Oklahoma-licensed AMC in whatever dollar amount is set by the ASC. The Board does need an invoice from the ASC in order to remit those fees. With the $25.00 per panel member formula the Board does not know how ASC can invoice us for an unknown amount from an unknown number of AMCs. It seems much more succinct to operate the AMC National Registry in the same manner that the appraiser National Registry is operated including allowing the states to upload a data file. Question 7: In the scenario set out in the prematurely issued and fundamentally-flawed proposed rules, it is very likely that we as the Board will have to hire an additional staff person to be responsible for management of the AMC licensing program, including maintenance of the National Registry data and collection of fees and related auditing. Oklahoma is in a budget crisis and there is a hiring freeze in place. The Board is very concerned we would not be allowed to hire a fourth employee and with limited resources, further burdens would be placed on the few employees on staff with no additional compensation permitted or provided to the states under federal law for service as the ASC\\'s collection agencies. Question 8: We as the Board see the biggest challenges with the requirement to obtain information and registry fees from federally-regulated AMC\\'s. There is no legal authority to allow us to manage any part of the requirement as stated in the proposed rules. Alternatively, it makes the most sense for the ASC to interact with and collect the fees from the federally-regulated AMC\\'s itself. A second concern is the manpower and resources available to this state jurisdiction to satisfactorily collect fees from an AMC with the formula suggested in the proposed rules. We as the Board have no way to confirm or verify that the number of panel members provided by an AMC is accurate or, if required to do so, that the appraisers stated to have received assignments, did and that the panel members who did not, actually did not, without some form of auditing. With a flat fee as proposed herein by the Board, there would be no need to audit, no need to collect additional information to verify the accuracy of what is provided and would most likely eliminate the possibility of limiting the 3 Appraisal Subcommittee July 6, 2016 number of appraisal assignments to a more limited number of appraisers. Further, if the ASC would accept data files as it does with the appraiser National Registry instead of requiring the states to manually input the data, an additional burden would be removed. Most jurisdictions have budget concerns and are short staffed. Without the benefit of receiving any of the millions of dollars in AMC National Registry revenue, we as the Board appear to now be placed in a position to have to do more work, without additional staff or additional revenue, for the benefit of the ASC. The proposed rules suggest we implement fees to recoup some of our loss, but really this is just one more layer of work being placed on us. Even should we attempt to do so, the legislature in Oklahoma is wholly against additional fees being placed on licensees. We do not believe our attempts would be successful. Beyond that, how do you suggest we as the Board implement a recovery fee from federally-regulated AMC\\'s that we have no jurisdiction or lawful authority over? Respectfully, we believe the proposed rules are structurally flawed and need to be reconsidered. In 2010 we were led to believe that there was no option but to implement an appraisal management company registration act. As we typically do, we got ahead of the requirement and have had an AMC registration program in place since 2011. Now it appears that that \\nthis program is optional. With the proposed rules being what they are, and the burdens being placed on the state, some of which are structurally and legally flawed we are seriously considering attempting to secure legislative repeal of our AMC law and opt out.

As such, it is the ASC, \\nand not the Agencies in this rulemaking, that will determine how to calculate and pay the AMC \\n\\n \\n \\nThe Final AMC Rule and the new proposed \\nAMC Registry R\\nule go to great le\\nngths to explain that the \\nregulation of AMCs extends to covered transactions, not just FRTs, because sections 1124(a)(3) and (a)(4) \\ndo not specifically call out FRTs and set out that appraisals coordinated by an AMC comply with USPAP and \\nthat appraisals ar\\ne conducted independently and free from undue influence.\\n \\nAs a result of the absence of a \\nreference to any type of transaction in those sections, whether it be an FRT or a covered transaction, in \\nsections 1124(a)(3) and (a)(4), the agencies stepped into th\\ne vacuum created by the absence of FRT \\nlanguage in those two sections and essentially filled that vacuum with the TILA definition of the kinds of \\ntransactions that need to be regulated.\\n \\nWe do believe this is a reasonable interpretation that allows the \\nreg\\nulation of AMC activities to ensure compliance with TILA. \\n \\n \\nHowever, when it comes to the collection of the Registry fee, it is not section 1124 of FIRREA that controls, \\nbut rather Section 1109.\\n \\n \\nSection 1109 of FIRREA, which addresses the authority to \\ncollect and transmit \\nfees, directs the collection of fees from AMCs.\\n \\nSee Section 1109(a)(4)(B).\\n \\n \\nAnd while section 1109(a)(4)(B), \\ndoes not specifically mention FRTs, Section 1109(a)(4)(A) specifically sets out that the fee for individual \\nappraisers is to\\n \\nbe based upon \\nFRTs\\n.\\n \\nWhen the guidance provided in Section 1109(a)(4)(A) for individuals \\nis interwoven with the fact that FIREAA has historically been applied to appraisals for FRTs, it is fair to \\nconclude that the extension o\\nf \\nCovered Transaction\\n \\nto the collection of the \\nR\\negistry fees under 1109(a)(4)(B) \\nfor AMCs is overreaching.\\n \\nIn addition, the fees that will be generated as a result of using the term \\nCovered \\nTransaction,\\n \\nrather than an FRT as the multiplier, will resul\\nt in the collection of fees that are excessive in \\nduplication as well as amount, greatly exceeding the mandate of the use of amounts set out in 1109(b) to \\nsupport the Registry and activities of the ASC.\\n \\n \\nB.\\n \\nThe Financial Impact \\nand Repercussions \\nwill be \\nMassive\\n \\n \\nCOMMENTS:\\n \\nREVAA members appreciate the effort by the ASC to \\ntry to \\nminimize the financial impact on \\nAMCs\\n, but in reality it is going to \\nbe massive and will prompt the industry to adapt accordingly\\n. The following \\nare potential implications from an AMC perspective:\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\nThe Difference Between Using \\nCovered Transaction\\n \\nvs. FRT\\n \\nis \\nSignificant\\n.\\n \\nBased on recent comments \\nby a senior representative of the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation (FDIC)\\n \\nin April 2016 to state \\nregulators\\n, the differences between the number of Covered Transactions and \\nFRT\\ns\\n \\nis immense.

And, if the federal de minimus threshold is increased to $500,000 as \\nproposed\\n, this could \\ndrop to 4%. If the AMC Registry fee was based on FRT\\ns\\n \\nthen it would result in a smaller financial burden \\n\\n \\n \\nIf this is accurate, the\\n \\ndecision\\n \\nto base the AMC National Registry \\nf\\nee on th\\ne larger universe defined as \\na \\nC\\novered \\nT\\nransaction \\n(88\\n-\\n96% of the transactions) \\ninstead of the much smaller universe associated \\nwith \\nFRT\\ns (4\\n-\\n12% of transactions)\\n \\nbrings in significantly more revenue \\nin fees \\nto the ASC for the \\nreasonable operation of the AMC Registry.\\n \\n \\n2\\n \\nR\\nE\\nV\\nA\\nA\\n \\n\\n7\\n34 \\n1\\n5\\nt\\nh \\nS\\nt\\nr\\ne\\ne\\nt\\n \\nN\\nW,\\n \\nS\\nu\\ni\\nte \\n9\\n00\\n \\n\\na\\nsh\\ni\\nng\\nto\\nn,\\n \\nD\\n.\\nC.\\n \\n20\\n0\\n05\\n \\n(612\\n) \\n716\\n-\\n181\\n\\nm\\na\\nr\\nk\\n.\\nsc\\nhi\\nf\\nf\\nm\\na\\nn\\n@\\nr\\nevaa\\n.org\\n \\n\\n \\nw\\nw\\nw.r\\neva\\na\\n.org\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nThe Multi\\nplying Effect of \\nAMC Registry \\nFee Collection \\n=\\n \\nExcessive \\nRevenue\\n. \\nThe methodology in the \\n\\neach state in which they execute a transaction.

We appreciate the ASC\\'s effort to create thoughtful standards for the implementation of the registry fee, which has been a source of concern for AMCs in particular since the issuance last June of the federal financial regulatory agencies\\' minimum standards for AMCs. From the potential interpretations of the phrase \"working for or contracting with\" offered in the proposed rule, it is implicit that the ASC understands the extent to which a fee based on panel size will have a financial impact on AMCs. Accordingly, while we support the ASC\\'s proposal to consider only those appraisers who have performed an appraisal for the AMC within the relevant reporting period to be \"working for or contracting with\" the AMC for purposes of assessing the registry fee, we request that the ASC consider a de minimis exception to that standard. We believe that such an exception would benefit not only AMCs, but also the lenders that rely on them for services and the state appraisal boards that \\nwill have to report on AMCs in fulfilling their duties under FIRREA. Atlanta Ł Beijing Ł Brussels Ł Charlotte Ł Dallas Ł Los Angeles Ł New York Ł Research Triangle Ł Silicon Valley Ł Washington, D.C. July 19,2016 Page 2 I. The ASC Should Consider De Minimis Exceptions to the Appraisers Considered to be \"Working for or Contracting with\" an AMC As the ASC is likely aware, the federal government sets a baseline for reporting independent contractor engagements. An entity need not provide a 1 099-MISC reporting form for any individual to whom it pays less than $600 during a tax year. 1 Put into context, an AMC would not have to issue a Form 1099 to an appraiser who performed only one appraisal assignment (or perhaps up to three assignments2) on its behalf. Although pursuant to the laws of the states in which it does business an AMC would have to maintain a record of assignments to such individuals, including the fees paid therefor, the AMC would not otherwise consider those individual appraisers as independent contractors for tax reporting purposes. Similarly, we suggest that the ASC consider tying its interpretation of appraisers \"working for or contracting with\" to the IRS 1099 threshold, and thus exclude from the interpretation those appraisers who perform three or fewer assignments for the entity during the fee reporting period. Such an exception would reduce not only the financial burden for AMCs, but also the compliance burden for states. In the case of an AMC that has 5,000 appraisers on its panel, the annual cost (assuming each appraiser performs one or more appraisals during the reporting period) would be $125,000. Estimating that just over 60 percent of an AMC\\'s panel members perform more than three appraisals for the entity in a given year, were the de minimis exception adopted, the annual cost for an AMC would be closer to $75,000. The savings for AMCs would be substantial. At the same time, including fewer appraisers would reduce States\\' reporting burden to the AMC, thereby easing their implementation of the ASC\\'s rule. In sum, a de minimis exception could benefit all parties on whom the final rule will have an impact. Furthermore, without a de minimis exception, the implementation of the ASC registry fee may have adverse consequences felt throughout the appraisal management and mortgage lending industries. Financial margins are slim for the great majority of appraisal management companies; for an appraiser who only performs one to three appraisals per year, the cost of the ASC registry fee may be greater than the marginal revenue the AMC would realize for those assignments. Accordingly, AMCs might reconsider whether to maintain as panel members appraisers who perform only one to three assignments on their behalf in a given year, ultimately reducing the size of their panels to include only appraisers with a higher assignment volume. Reductions would most likely impact appraisers in rural areas, where assignments are less frequent; in turn, having fewer appraisers available to complete such assignments would increase the time frame for fulfillment of appraisal orders. Such reductions might also deter appraisers from serving rural and other low-volume areas, or from entering the profession altogether. AMCs 1 See 2016 Instructions for I 099-MISC, available at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i I \\n099msc.pdf. 2 As the ASC is aware, fees for assignments may vary based upon factors including, but not limited to, the product type (full or partial) and the assignment type (i.e., appraisal review). Thus, we estimate the $600 threshold to capture appraisers who have performed up to three assignments for an AMC. July 19, 2016 Page 3 might even cease business operations in low-volume states, in which the majority of their panel members perform only a few assignments per year; having fewer AMCs available would be a detriment to lenders, who would have fewer vendors to rely on when originating residential mortgage loans. We do not believe that the ASC intends such consequences in implementing the AMC registry fee, and thus respectfully request that the ASC consider them before finalizing the proposed rule. II.

After a review of the Proposed Rules, we would offer the following comments: Ł The Washington State Appraisal Management Company Program (the \"Program\") has several serious concerns regarding the administrative and monetary burdens required for implementation. In general, the Program foresees several barriers to collecting reliable data regarding how many Appraisers are on an AMC panel during a specific time period. Washington does not currently most of the data that would be required to formulate the fee required from each AMC\\'s panel-how many Appraisers are on an AMC panel and/or how many appraisals each Appraiser has conducted during a reporting period. At a minimum, the Program would need to adopt new rules, create new forms to request this data, and update its current operating systems to keep track of this data. Ł With respect to the three options on page 31870 of the Federal Register, we believe the third option would be the most effective for the State of Washington and its registered AMC\\'s. To administer this option would assist the State to create a uniform reporting standard for AMC\\'s to follow. This would likely reduce data collection costs and would be easier for the program\\'s IT Department to implement. We are committed to providing equal access to our services. For information visit dol.wa.gov/access. (TDD/TTY call 711) Washington Appraiser Program Letter to ASC July 18, 2016 Page-2-Ł With respect to whether the ASC should collect information and fees directly from federally regulated AMC\\'s that wish to appear on the National Registry but operate in States that do not elect to register and supervise AMC\\' s, we offer the following comment: Ł Based on the administrative and monetary concerns associated with State implementation of the proposed fee collection rule, it makes sense that if the federal government has the capacity to collect information and fees directly from AMC\\'s that operate in States that do not register AMCs, it should do so for AMC\\'s in all states. This would streamline the collection process and would prevent nationwide AMC\\'s from having to submit a patchwork of documentation to each individual State. Ł Based on the current proposed rule, the Program foresees additional costs for implementation of the proposed rule in the following areas: Ł IT costs to update operating systems, transmission costs from state to ASC, and development of new database to house information; Ł Increased labor costs for staff needed for implementation of proposed rules. Ł While it is understandable to collect fees from AMC\\'s to be a part of the ASC\\'s National Registry, from an implementation perspective, it would be easier for the Program if the Appraisal Subcommittee adopted a flat-fee approach rather than a sliding scale. Again, thank you opportunity to comment on the Proposed Rules, and please let us know if we can be of any further assistance. Sincerely, Dee A.

The \\nrule as currently drafted has \\na \\nsubstantial \\nimpact on small \\nentities which include specialized AMC\\n\\ns, Community Banks, \\nlocal Credit \\nUnions\\n, and individual appraisers\\n.  \\n \\nThe \\nRegulatory Flexibility Act \\nrequires an agency to perform a \\nregulatory flexibility analysis of small entity impacts when the ag\\nency\\n\\ns rule directly regulates the small \\nentities. \\n  \\nJust because a business niche is \\nspecialized, \\ndoes not mean that \\nit \\nis not vitalit\\ny important to \\nthe industry \\nand financial institutions \\nit serves.  \\n \\n \\nThe AMC regulat\\nions were driven by \\nlarger institu\\ntions \\nand\\n \\nthe resi\\ndential sector.  \\nHowever, they are \\ndrafted in a manner t\\nhat impacts commercial, industrial, agricultural, \\nand complex propert\\ny appraisals \\nand procedures.  \\nThese \\npropert\\ny types \\nare pr\\nimary lending sectors for\\n \\nsmall Community Banks and \\nCredit Unions\\n.  \\nOn a pure \\nvolume\\n \\nbasis, th\\nese property categories \\nmay no\\nt be substant\\nial\\n.  H\\nowever, on \\nan economi\\nc basis, this sector is very important to the \\nsmall communities, rural America, and the \\nsmaller \\nfinancial \\ninstitutions \\nand serve these markets.  \\n \\n \\nIt is not clear whether the agency fully understands or has considered the impact on small AMC\\ns\\n.  \\nThe \\nFederal Interagency Appraisal and\\n \\nEvaluation Guidelines \\nrequire\\n \\nall financial institutions to maintain \\nstrict independence in the appraisal ordering, management, and review process.\\n  \\nThis applies to all \\ntransactions, whether they \\nare\\n \\nresidential, commercial, agricultural, or other. \\n \\nSmaller C\\nommunity \\nB\\nanks \\nand \\nC\\nredit \\nU\\nnions (typical u\\nnder $100 \\nmillion in assets)\\n \\nare not large enough to have their own internal \\nindependent appraisal departments. \\n \\nTo \\nsatisfy this \\nindependence \\nrequirement m\\nany \\nsmaller \\nlenders \\nmust \\nuse the services of an AMC.  \\n \\n \\nI\\n \\nown \\na small AMC that serves \\nsmall\\n \\nCommunity Banks and Credit Unions\\n \\nthat lack the \\nexpertise and \\nstaffing neces\\nsary to effectively implement an\\n \\nindependent \\n \\nin\\n-\\nhouse \\nrisk\\n-\\nbased apprai\\nsal management \\nand re\\nview \\nsystem.\\n  \\nAs currently proposed, the regulatory fees are exceptionally burdensome for small \\nAMCs and \\nconsequently, the \\nsmaller \\nfinancial institutions which \\nthey \\nserve.\\n \\n \\nDue to the limited number \\nof \\nCommunity Banks \\nand \\nCredit Unions\\n,\\n \\nthere are not many \\nAMC\\n\\ns which \\nspecialize in commercial and \\nagricultural properties\\n;\\n \\nhowever, the\\n \\nservices \\nwhich we provide \\nare inva\\nluable\\n \\nand a regulatory \\nnecessity\\n \\nfor \\nappropriate risk management and regulatory compliance\\n \\nfor \\nthese small \\ninstitutions.\\n  \\n \\n \\nSmaller \\nCommunity Banks generally make very few residential loan\\ns and \\nmay only make 10 to 100 \\ncommercial/agricultural loans in a given year. \\n \\nThe appraisal ordering, management, and review process \\nfor \\nthese \\ncommercial and agricultural properties is significantly different\\n \\nand requires greater expertise\\n \\nthan for residential properties.\\n  \\nWith \\na \\nresidential property, the AMC generally knows nothing about the \\nproperty, other than the address.\\n  \\nWith a commercial or agricultural loan, the \\nappraisal bidding and \\nordering process requires that the \\nAMC \\nbe \\nhighly knowledgeable of the local market, specific physical \\nand legal factors associated with the subject property, and the capabilities of \\nindividual appraisers \\nqualified to perform the assignment. \\n  \\nAMCs that handle com\\nmercial/\\nagricultural properties will \\nusually \\nperform \\nsignificantly fewer jobs in a given year than the typical residential AMC.\\n  \\n \\n \\nLarger financial \\ninstitutions\\n \\nwill have an \\nin\\n-\\nhouse appraisal management \\nand review \\ndepartment\\n \\nto \\nhandle co\\nmmercial and agricultural appraisal ordering and reviews.  Smaller institutions \\ndo not need \\nand \\ncannot afford full time staf\\nf to \\nhandle this function for\\n \\n10 \\nto 100 loans per year.  \\n \\nTherefore, they \\nrequire the service of an outside firm \\nto establish the independence \\nof \\nthe \\nappraisal \\nordering process \\nand \\nprovide the \\nexpe\\nrtise to \\nensure that the appraisals have the \\nappropriate\\n \\nscope of\\n \\nwork\\n,\\n \\nare \\nUSPAP \\ncompliant, and conform to Interagency Appraisal and Evaluation Guidelines.  \\nThe rules as currently \\nproposed have a significant adverse impact on AMCs that \\nserve \\nthis sector of the market.  \\n \\n \\nCommercial and\\n \\nagricultural loans are complex assignments that by their very nature do not lend \\nthemselves to \\nbeing managed by large\\n-\\nscale \\nAMCs \\nthat do not have expertise in a wide range of \\nproperty types, local market conditions, and the expertise \\nand skill set of \\nindividual appraiser\\ns\\n. \\n \\n \\n \\nI\\n \\nwill \\nuse my business as an example\\n;\\n \\nhowever, there are \\nmany other \\nsmall\\n \\nspecialized \\nAMCs that serve \\nsimilar clients.  \\nIn a given year, my firm may handle 200 to 300 appraisal engagement and review \\nassignments.\\n \\n \\nWe have a staff of three full\\n-\\ntime employees\\n.  \\nWe serve six smaller Community Banks and \\ncredit unions based in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho\\n.\\n  \\nW\\ne\\n \\nfocus primarily on commercial, industrial, \\nand agricultu\\nral properties\\n; h\\nowever, we do provide some residential \\nappraisal management and \\nreview.\\n  \\nThe lenders we serve all retain these loans in \\ntheir portfolio \\nand \\ndo not sell them on the \\nsecondary market.\\n \\n \\nBecause\\n \\nof\\n \\nthe complex nature of \\nthe\\n \\nproperties we handle, \\nthere is little redundancy \\nin \\nproperty types\\n, \\nlocations\\n, and appraiser\\n\\ns fees\\n \\nor timing.  Therefore, \\nwe may utilize the services of 150 appraisers in a \\ngiven year.\\n  \\nHowever, s\\neveral \\nof these appraisers \\nwill \\nperform an assignment in \\nOregon\\n, \\nWashingto\\nn\\n, \\nand\\n/or \\nIdaho\\n \\nin any given year.  T\\nherefore, \\nwe \\nwould be required to pay a fee for this same appraiser in \\neach state\\n \\nin which they perfor\\nm\\n \\na service.\\n  \\n \\nIt would not be unusual for \\nthis to happen in 25\\n-\\n50 \\ninstances in a given year.  \\nThis should bring the total \\nfee \\nbase to \\na minimum of \\n175\\n \\nto 200\\n.  \\nA\\n \\nfee of \\n$25/appraiser \\nresults in \\nminimum \\ntotal \\nnew \\nfees \\nto the ASC \\nof \\n$4\\n,\\n375 per year\\n.  \\n \\n \\nThese ASC fees are in addition to the licensing and bonding fees required \\nby\\n \\neach individual state.\\n  \\nThe \\nannual \\nAMC \\nlicensing fee is Oregon is \\n$1,500 \\nper year.  The \\nWashington licensing fee is $1\\n,\\n200 per year.\\n  \\nIdaho is in the process of establishing the AMC licensing \\nrules \\nand is reasonable to expect \\nthat the\\nir fees \\nwill be similar at \\napproximate\\nl\\ny\\n \\n$1\\n,20\\n0/year.\\n  \\nTotal licensing fees are $3,900.\\n \\n \\nIn addition to the license fees, \\neach State requires a \\nseparate bond\\n.  \\nWashington requires a $100,000 \\nbond. \\n \\nOregon\\n\\ns\\n \\nbond is $25,000.\\n \\n \\nIt is assumed that Idaho \\nwill \\nbe at least $25,000.\\n  \\nTotal \\nbonding fees \\nare 1% of the bond amount, which \\nis $1,500 per year.    We \\nare \\nalso \\nrequired to maintain \\nerrors and \\nomissions insurance \\nwhich is \\napproximate\\nly\\n \\n$2\\n,\\n500 per year.\\n \\n \\nThe total fees are summarized as follows:\\n \\n \\nAppraisal Subcommittee \\n-\\n \\n \\n$4,375\\n \\nState Licenses \\n-\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n$3,900\\n \\nBond\\ns\\n \\n-\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n$1,500\\n \\nErrors and Omissions \\n-\\n \\n \\n \\n$\\n2,500\\n \\nTotal \\n-\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n$12,275\\n \\n \\nBy far the greatest fee is the new fee\\n \\nimposed by the Appraisal Subcommittee.  In my firm the fee for \\nappraisal ordering varies from $125 to $250 per assignment, depending upon the \\nproperty type, \\nc\\nomplexity\\n, and location.  We average approxima\\ntely $200 per assignment.  Based upon an average \\nvolume of 2\\n0\\n0 appraisal ordering assignments in a \\nyear, \\nresults in total AMC income of $\\n40,000. \\n \\nT\\nhe\\n \\nregulatory fee burden of $12,275\\n \\nis 31% of the gross income.  \\nThe new Appraisal Subcommittee fee is \\n11% of gross income.  \\nThis is in direct conflict\\n \\nwith the statement \\nthat \\nthe\\n \\nproposed rule will not have a \\nsignificant impact on \\nsmall\\n \\nentities.  \\n \\n \\nThe proposed rules impact\\n \\nsmall entities the most.  \\nThe fee s\\ntructure has \\na disp\\nroportionate \\nimpact\\n \\non \\nmy small firm \\nand \\nother\\ns\\n \\nlike \\nmine.  \\nThis additional regulatory burden \\nhas the potential to \\ndrive small \\nspecialized businesses out of business.  This will have a substantial negative impact on the \\nCommunity \\nB\\nanks a\\nnd \\nC\\nredit \\nU\\nnion\\ns we serve.  \\nTheir loan volume is not sufficient\\n \\nto \\nwarrant the \\nhiring and\\n \\nspecialized \\ntraining \\nof \\nan in\\n-\\nhouse \\nreal estat\\ne expert for \\ntheir \\nsmall \\nnumber of loans.  \\nThis will severely \\nlimit their ability to \\ncomply\\n \\nwith the appraisal independence and review processes mandated by the \\nInteragency Guidelines\\n.\\n \\n \\nThe\\nre are several large \\nAMCs \\nin our region that\\n \\nperform 5,000 to 10,000 appraisal engagement \\nassignments in per year.  They may use a single appraiser for 20\\n-\\n100 jobs per year.  They can spread th\\ne \\nregulatory \\nfee \\nburden \\nof $25\\n/appraiser\\n \\nacross \\na much broader base.  \\nUnfortunately, these large firms \\nlack the knowledge, expe\\nrtise, and skill\\n \\nto handle \\ncomplex \\ncommer\\nci\\nal and agricultu\\nral assignments and \\nthey cannot properly serve Community Banks and Credit Unions. \\n  \\n \\n \\nA phrase that is becoming increasingly common in the industry is \\n\\ntoo small to comply, too small to \\nsurvive\\n\\n.   Unfortunately,\\n \\ndue to \\nthe com\\nplexity of the assignments and the \\nsmall size of the Banks and \\nCredit Unions \\nwhich firms of my type serve, \\nour services \\ncannot \\nbe scaled up to 1,000 + assignments per \\nyear.  \\nThe complexit\\ny it too great to process that number of pr\\noperty appraisals.  Firms that handle \\ncommercial and agricultural properties simply \\ncannot \\nachieve large economies of scale to \\nspread the \\nregulatory \\nfee burden. \\n  \\nThe regulatory fee burden is likely to drive many of the best small businesses in \\nthe \\nindustry\\n \\nout of \\nbusiness.  \\n \\n \\n \\nCommunity Banks are an integral part of the \\ncities and rural areas \\nthey serve.  They provide the \\nbusiness \\nloans that are necessary for \\nmany small businesses to \\nsurvive. \\n  \\nLarger national banks rarely make loans \\nin small town America.  \\nIt is the local Communit\\ny Bank\\n \\nand C\\nredit Union that \\ntypically makes the loan to \\nthe \\nlocal \\nrestaurant\\n,\\n \\nbarbershop, rental center, insurance agent, \\nlocal farmer, \\netc.  If we close down\\n,\\n \\nthrough regulatory fees\\n,\\n \\nall means for the Community Banks to maintain \\nindependence i\\nn their \\nappraisal \\nordering and review process, how are they to perform proper risk management and \\nmeet \\nregulatory \\nguidelines\\n?\\n \\n \\nOn a secondary \\nissue\\n, it is obvious that we \\nhave implemented laws and rules\\n \\nthat greatly increase \\nregulatory management at both the \\nS\\ntate and \\nF\\nederal levels. \\n \\nIt appears that most of this regulatory \\noversight is duplicitous.\\n  \\nIn order for an AMC to provide services for \\na \\nF\\nederally \\nrelated transaction, the \\nS\\ntate must have an AMC registry and oversight process. \\n  \\nIf the \\nS\\ntate \\nis monitoring and \\nregulating\\n \\neach\\n \\nAMC according to Federal regulations, \\nthe question must be raised \\nas \\nto\\n \\nhow much management and \\noversight does the Appraisal Subcommitte\\ne\\n \\nreally need to do\\n \\nand how much \\nshould\\n \\nit\\n \\nreally cost for \\nthis \\nAMC oversight?\\n  \\n \\n \\nOre\\ngon is an average sized State.   \\nIn Oregon, between 80,000 and \\n120,000\\n \\napprais\\nals\\n \\nare ordered by \\nAMCs each year.\\n  \\nThere are approximate 1400 licensed appraiser\\ns in the \\nS\\ntate\\n \\nand \\n140 registered AMCs.\\n  \\nA small AMC like mine may do \\nbusiness\\n \\nwith 150 appraisers in the State in a given year.  However, the \\naverage AMC \\ndoes a much higher volume and \\nwill \\nlikely \\ndo \\nbusiness with \\n200 to \\n5\\n00 appraisers in a \\ngiven year.  Assuming a \\nvery \\nconservative 200 appraisers per 140 AMC\\n\\ns at $25/appraiser, results in total \\nfees to the A\\nppraisal Subcommittee \\nof $700,000 from\\n \\nOregon alone.  \\nWe are an average sized State.  If \\nthis is applied to 50 States, this transla\\ntes to $35,000,000 per yea\\nr in \\nregistry \\nfee \\nrevenue\\n.  \\nDoes it really \\ncost this much \\nto provide oversite over 500 AMCs in the nati\\non\\n, especially when the States are already \\nproviding this same service\\n?  \\n \\n \\n \\nT\\nhe proposed rules state that the \\n\\nAMC \\nregistry fee would adequate\\nly\\n \\ncover those costs while \\nsupporting other \\nT\\nitle XI functions of the ASC as mandated by Congress, including \\nfurther \\ndevelopment \\nof its grant programs, partic\\nularly for \\nS\\ntates.\\n\\n   \\nThe question must be raised as to whether or not it is \\nappropriate to charge fees \\nthat drive \\nsmall \\nbusinesses out of \\nbusiness to \\nfund \\nother \\nprograms and \\nfunctions which are not directly associated wi\\nth \\nthe operation of that small \\nbusiness.  \\n \\n \\nThe rules do not appear to properly consider the \\nR\\negulatory \\nF\\nlexibility \\nA\\nct which\\n \\nrequires \\nconsider\\nation \\nof the \\nimpact of the proposed rules on small entities. \\n \\nMy firm is a \\nsmall entity and there are many \\nothers like my firm.\\n \\n \\nTh\\ne proposed rule \\nalso impacts the \\nsmall \\nC\\nommunity \\nB\\nanks and \\nC\\nredit \\nU\\nnions \\nwhich \\nrequire the services of small specialty firms such as mine\\n \\nto meet regulatory guidelines\\n.\\n \\n \\nMany \\nAMCs \\ncharge the individual appraiser to be on their approved appraiser panel\\n. \\n \\nThese fees will likely \\nin\\ncrease in order for the AMC to pay the required registry fees.\\n \\n \\nTherefore, \\nregistration fees \\nwill \\nalso \\nha\\nve a \\ndirect impact on\\n \\nindividual\\n \\nappraisers, which by their very nature are small entities. \\n \\n \\nThe proposed \\nregistry \\nfee \\nstructure benefits large financ\\nial institutions which \\ncan support in\\n-\\nhouse \\nappraisal management and review departments\\n,\\n \\nwhich are exempt from \\nregistry fees to the ASC. \\n  \\nIt \\nalso provides a competitive advantage to the large AMCs that are able to ut\\nilize a single apprais\\ner\\n \\nfor a \\nlarger volume of appraisals.\\n \\n \\nThe regulatory fee burden \\nstructure is \\npunitive \\nand \\ncreates \\na competitive \\ndisadvantage to \\nsmall AMCs,\\n \\nwhich\\n \\nwill \\nadversely\\n \\nimpact the ability of local \\nCommunity Banks\\n \\nand \\nC\\nredit \\nU\\nnions\\n \\nto ensure\\n \\nappraisal independence\\n, \\nproper risk management\\n, and provide the loans and \\nservices \\nthat small businesses need\\n.  \\n \\n \\n \\nI would welcome the opportunity to discuss this situation \\nwith \\nany part\\ny\\n \\ni\\nnterested in creating a \\nregulatory environment that enhances the\\n \\nquality\\n \\nand integrity of the system\\n \\nwithout placing undue \\nburden on the small businesses that serve the smaller communities and rural areas of \\nthe\\n \\nc\\nountry.  \\n \\n \\n \\nRegards,\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nDean Cameron, MAI, AI\\n-\\nGRS, CCIM\\n \\nOwner, Real Estate Risk Solutions\\n \\n3725 Klindt Drive\\n \\nT\\nhe\\n \\nDalles, OR  97058\\n \\n541\\n-\\n705\\n-\\n5028\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

This rule should have a definition of \"covered transaction\". The AMC rule defines a covered transaction as \"any consumer credit transaction secured by the consumer\\'s principal dwelling.\" This definition should be added to Proposed Rule §1102.401. In the alternative, there should be a footnote with a citation as to where the definition may be found. As a side note, it is difficult to see how an AMC would know that the subject property is or will be the consumer\\'s principal dwelling. The default position for an AMC would have to be to consider any appraisal done of a one to four family residential property is that of a principal dwelling. 2. Proposed Rule §1102.402 (c) addresses an AMC that has been in existence for more than a year. The rule would require the AMC to pay the fee for appraisers who have performed appraisals in the previous year. States should have the ability to establish a definition of \"previous year\". It can be a calendar year or it could be a cutoff day, as long it was the same each year. For example, in North Carolina, AMC registration expires on June 30 of each year. We would prefer to establish a cutoff date as May 1, so that an AMC may have time to calculate its renewal fees, get the check cut, have it mailed and received by the state, and the renewal issued by June 30. Would this be allowable under the proposed rule? July 19, 2016 Page Two 3. Proposed Rule §1102.402 (b) addresses an AMC that has not been in existence for more than a year. The rule would require the AMC to pay the fee for appraisers who have performed appraisals since the AMC commenced doing business. Again, there needs to some cutoff date. Must an AMC in North Carolina wait until June 30 to determine how many appraisers have performed assignments since they began doing business? If so, the AMC would not be able to renew its registration on time, which would result in the payment of late fees. We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Proposed Rule and look forward to receiving the final report. DTR:ro Very truly yours, Roberta Ouellette Legal Counsel ',\n",

Park Executive Director July 19, 2016 SENT VIA EMAIL webmaster@asc.gov Appraisal SubCommittee Suite 760 Federal eR ul emaking Portal www.regulations.gov 1401 H. Street NW Washington, D.C. 20005 Re: Comment for Docket Number AS16-06 (Proposed Rulemaking for Collection and Transmission of Annual AMC Registry Fees) Dear Mr. Park: On behalf of the Pennsylvania State Board of Certified Real Estate Appraisers (Board), I am submitting a comment in response to the Appraisal Subcommittee\\'s notice of proposed rulemaking for the collection and transmission of annual AMC registry fees. 1. The ASC considered three options with respect to interpreting \"worldng for or contracting with, \" and chose to utilize the third option. The Board supports the third option, which is contained in the Proposed Rule. This option is the least burdensome to appraisers and AMCs because the registry fee will only be applied to those appraisers that have performed work in the state. Additionally, of the three options, the third option will be the least burdensome to the Board, from an administrative standpoint, because it provides clear direction as to whether an appraiser worked with or contracted with an AMC by applying the registry fee to those appraisers that provided an appraisal service to an AMC. The first option, which includes every appraiser on an AMC appraiser panel in a particular state, including appraisers who did not perform an appraisal in the state during the 12 month period, is overly burdensome and may encourage AMCs to limit the number of appraisers on its panel. Therefore, the Board does not support this option. DEPARTMENT OF STATE/OFFICE OF CHIEF COUNSEL 2601 NORTH 3RO STREET/P.O. Box 69523//HARRISBURG, PA 17106-9523 PHONE: 717-783-7200/FAX: 717-787-0251/ WWW.DOS.PA.GOV Ł pennsylvania The Board does not support the second option because defining \"working for or contracting with\" to include those appraisers engaged by the AMC to perform an appraisal on a covered transaction will create confusion and will be difficult to administer because whether an appraiser is engaged on a particular assigmnent could be interpreted inconsistently. Additionally, applying a registry fee to an appraiser who has been engaged but did not perform work is overly burdensome. 2. The ASC requested comment on all aspects of proposed collection and transmission of annual AMC registry fees. Annual collection of registry fees. Unlike the national registry fee for certified real estate appraisers, the Proposed Rule requires states to collect the AMC registry fee on an aruma! basis. As is the case with most states, Pennsylvania renews its AMC registrations on a biennial basis. This is a Pennsylvania statutory requirement. Collecting AMC registry fees on an annual basis will be difficult to administer because the Board will have to collect and transmit registry fees outside of its renewal period. The Board will have to set \\nup administratively, and from an IT standpoint, a system to collect the registry fees on an annual basis. This will add costs to the Board\\'s operating expenses. The Board urges the ASC to consider allowing collection of registry fee on a biennial basis to lessen the burden on states. Collecting fees outside of the normal renewal period also raises questions from an enforcement standpoint. Under the Pennsylvania Appraisal Management Company Registration Act (AMC Act), the Board has the authority to impose disciplinary action where an AMC\\'s application for registration or renewal of registration contains false or misleading information. To the extent that ASC anticipates that states will engage in enforcement efforts for false information relating to registry fees, the Board may not have the authority to impose discipline if the registry fee is collected outside of an initial or renewal application. Administrative burden on Pennsylvania The Proposed Rule creates a significant administrative burden on the Board. Unlike the national registry fee for certified real estate appraisers, the AMC registry fee is not a flat fee, but rather, a fee that must be calculated by the AMCs, and presumably, verified to some extent by the Board. The Board will have to create an administrative process, which will include IT expenditures, to administer and transmit the registry fee. The Board has concerns about collecting registry fees from AMCs that operate as a subsidiary of a federally regulated financial institutions, which are exempt from the AMC Act. Unlike collecting fees from AMCs that are registered with the Board, the Board does not have record or information about these federally regulated AMCs. Thus, determining the extent to which the Board will be burdened is difficult, if not impossible. However, the Board would have to set up a system, both administratively and from an IT standpoint, to track and administer the registry fees for the exempt AMCs. Only those AMCs that meet the federal definition of AMC are eligible to be on the AMC Registry. It is unclear to what extent the Board staff will have to verify or determine whether AMCs meet the federal definition of AMCs. In Pennsylvania, an AMC is defined as a person that provides appraisal management service and acts as a third-party intermediary between a person seeking a valuation of real estate located in Pennsylvania and an appraiser or firm of appraisers. Because the Board does not currently analyze the size of AMC panels for the purposes of registration, the Board will have to develop procedures and train staff on this detennination. 3. The ASC requested comment on federally regulated AMCs operating in a State that does not elect to register and supervise AMCs. Pennsylvania has elected to register and supervise AMCs; therefore, the Board neither supports nor opposes ASC collecting information and fees from federally regulated AMCs in states that have not elected to register and supervise AMCs. However, if ASC sets up a system to collect registry fees in those states, then tl1e Board questions the efficiency and prudence of having states that have elected to register and supervise AMCs set up separate and individualized systems for collecting AMC fees. Presumably, ASC would set up an automated electronic/computerized system for collecting fees, which could be utilized for the collection of all AMC registry fees. 4. The ASC requested comment on what costs (both direct and in terms offees and indirect in terms of administrative costs) would be associated with collection and transmission of AMC registry fees? The Board would incur additional costs for the collection and transmission of AMC registry fees, including but not limited to: initial start-up costs to set up a system to collect registry fees on an · annual basis and to document registry fees received for the exempt AMCs; IT costs; creation of appropriate forms and revision of applications; training for staff for the implementation of collection and transmission of fees; increased staff costs due to processing registry applications and fees; and increased legal fees to ensure compliance with federal law. The Board has not had sufficient time to quantify these costs; therefore, it cannot provide specific projected expenses. 5. The ASC requested comment on what aspects of the Proposed Rule, if any, would be challenging for States to implement? To the extent such challenges would exist, what alternative approached do commenters suggest that would make implementation easier, while maintaining consistency with the statute? As discussed above, one of the most challenging aspects is the collection offees on an annual basis. The Board strongly urges ASC to consider allowing states to collect the registry fees on a bie1mial basis and in conjunction with biennial renewal. Additionally, the Board urges ASC to consider implementing and coordinating with states to develop a centralized computerized system for collecting registry fees. To have states set up separate and unique systems is not a prudent use of state and federal monies. Section 1109 of Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, as amended, 12 U.S.C. § 3338, provides that amounts collected by ASC shall be used for specified purposes. ASC should consider using money collected for a centralized internet based or computerized system for states to utilize that would collect the necessary information and allow for the submission of registry fees. Additionally, ASC has the authority to provide grants to State appraiser certifying and licensing agencies to support the efforts of state agencies, including but not limited to the submission of data on state licensed/certified appraiser and appraisal management companies to the registry. Given the burden placed on state agencies, such grants are necessary and appropriate. The Board urges the ASC to incorporate in the Proposed Rule, the provision of grants to states for the implementation of the registry. The Board asks the ASC to consider calculating grants based upon actual costs incurred by states or, in the alternative, based upon a percentage of monies received by ASC. On behalf of the Board, I thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Proposed Rule. Please feel free to contact the Board if you have any questions. Sincerely, D. Thomas Smith, Chainnan Pennsylvania State Board of Certified Real Estate Appraisers cc: Lori Schuster, Management and Program Analyst COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR\\'S OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL SENT VIA FIRST CLASS MAIL Mr. James R. Park Executive Director Appraisal SubCommittee Suite 760 1401 H. StreetNW Washington, D.C. 20005 July 19,2016 SENT VIA EMAIL webmaster@asc. gov Federal eRulemaking Portal www.regulations.gov Re: Comment for Docket Number AS 16-06 (Proposed Rulemaking for Collection and Transmission of A1mual AMC Registry Fees) Dear Mr. Park: On behalf of the Pennsylvania State Board of Certified Real Estate Appraisers (Board), I am submitting a comment in response to the Appraisal Subcommittee\\'s notice of proposed rulemaking for the collection and transmission of annual AMC registry fees. 1. The ASC considered three options with respect to interpreting \"worldng for or contracting with, \" and chose to utilize the third option. The Board supports the third option, wfifch is contained in the Proposed Rule. This option is t11e. least burdensome to appraisers and AMCs because the registry fee will only be applied to those appraisers that have performed work in the state. Additionally, of the three options, the third option will be the least burdensome to the I3oard, from an administrative standpoint, because it provides clear as to whether an appraiser work<idwith or contracted with an AMC by ·applying the registry fee to those appraisers that provided an appraisal service to an AMC. · The first option, which includes every appraiser on an AMC appraiser panel in a pmiicular state, including appraisers who did not perform an appraisal in the state during the 12 month period, is overly burdensome and may encourage AMCs to limit the number of appraisers on its panel. Therefore, the Board does not support this option. DEPARTMENT OF STATE/OFFICE OF CHIEF COUNSEL 2601 NORTH 3RD STREET/P.O. Box 695231/HARRISBURG, PA 17106-9523 PHONE: 717 -783-7200/FAX: 717-787:0251/ WWW.DOS.PA.GOV The Board does not support the second option because defining \"working for or conu·acting with\" to include those appraisers engaged by the AMC to perform an appraisal on a covered transaction will create confusion and will be difficult to administer because whether an appraiser is engaged on a particular assignment could be interpreted inconsistently. Additionally, applying a registry fee to an appraiser who has been engaged but did not perform work is burdensome. 2. The ASC requested comment on all aspects of proposed collection and transmission of annual AMC registry fees. Annual collection of registry fees. Unlike the national registry fee for certified real estate appraisers, the Proposed Rule requires states to collect the AMC registly fee on an annual basis. As is the case with most states, Pennsylvania renews its AMC registrations on a biennial basis. This is a Pennsylvania statutory requirement. Collecting AMC registry fees on an annual basis will be difficult to administer because the Board will have to collect and transmit registry fees outside of its renewal period. The Board will have to set up administratively, and from an IT standpoint, a system to collect the registry fees on an annual basis. This will add costs to the Board\\'s operating expenses. The Board urges the ASC to consider allowing collection of registry fee on a biennial basis to lessen the burden on states. Collecting fees outside of the normal renewal period also raises questions from an enforcement standpoint. Under the Petmsylvania Appraisal Management Company Registration Act (AMC Act), the Board has the authority to impose disciplinary action where an AMC\\'s application for registration or renewal of registration contains false or misleading infonnation. To the extent that ASC anticipates that states will engage in enforcement efforts for false information relating to registry fees, the Board may not have the authority to impose discipline if the registry fee is collected outside of an initial or renewal application. Administrative burden on Pennsylvania \\'\\'The Proposed Rule creates a significant administrativeburden on the Board. Unlike.the national registry fee for cetiified real estate appraisers, the AMC registry fee is not a flat fee, but rather, a fee that must be calculated by the AMCs, and presumably, verified to some extent by the Board . . The Board will have to ·create an administrativeprocess, which will inch.1de IT--expenditures, to administer and transmit the regist:ly fee, · The Board has concems about collecting registry fees from AMCs that operate as a subsidiary of a federally regulated financial institutions, which are exempt from the AMC Act. Unlike collecting fees from AMCs that are registered with tl1e Board, the Board does not have record or infom1ation about these federally regulated AMCs. Thus, determining the extent to which the Board will be burdened is difficult, if not impossible. However, the Board would have to set up \\'\\'>{\\'\\'\\' a system, both administratively and from an IT standpoint, to track and administer the registry fees for the exempt AMCs. Only those AMCs that meet the federal definition of AMC are eligible to be on the AMC Registry. It is unclear to what extent the Board staff will have to verify or determine whether AMCs meet the federal definition of AMCs. In Pennsylvania, an AMC is defined as a person that provides appraisal management service and acts as a third-party intermediary between a person seeking a valuation of real estate located in Pennsylvania and an appraiser or finn of appraisers. Because the Board does not currently analyze the size of AMC panels for the purposes of registration, the Board will have to develop procedures and train staff on this determination. 3. The ASC requested comment on federally regulated AMCs operating in a State that does not elect to register and supervise AMCs. Pennsylvania has elected to register and supervise AMCs; therefore, the Board neither supports nor opposes ASC collecting infonnation and fees from federally regulated AMCs in states that have not elected to register and supervise AMCs. However, if ASC sets up a system to collect registry fees in those states, then the Board questions the efficiency and prudence of having states that have elected to register and supervise AMCs set up separate and individualized systems for collecting AMC fees. Presumably, ASC would set up an automated electronic/computerized system for collecting fees, which could be utilized for the collection of all AMC registry fees. 4. The ASC requested comment on what costs (both direct and in terms offees and indirect in terms of administrative costs) would be associated with collection and transmission of AMC registry fees? The Board would incur additional costs for the collection and transmission of AMC registry fees, including but not limited to: initial start-up \\ncosts to set up a system to collect registry fees on an annual basis and to document registry fees received for the exempt AMCs; IT costs; creation of appropriate forms and revision of applications; training for staff for the implementation of collection and transmission of fees; increased staff costs due to processing registry applications and fees; and increased legal fees to ensure compliance with federal law. The Board has not had sufficient time to quantify these costs; therefore, it cannot provide specific projected expenses. 5. ·The ASC reqyested comment ol1!\\'what aspects·oftheProposed Rule, .if any, w_ou(d be ..... .. . challenging for States to implement?,I\\'o\"the.extent such challenges would exist,. what alternative approached do commenters suggest that would make implementation easier, while maintaining consistency with the statute?
