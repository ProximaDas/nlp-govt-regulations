The Westlawn Partnership for a Healthier Environment  is a group of community stakeholders  that   has met on a regular basis since 2008 to identify, prioritize, and address environmental  health concerns in the Westlawn community.  Located in northwest Milwaukee, Westlawn is   - subsidized housing development.     Milwauke e County ranks as the worst county in the State of Wisconsin for asthma - related  hospitalizations and emergency department visits.  Moreover, specific to  the  Westlawn   community , the rate of hospitalizations for asthma among children is nearly twice that of  Mi l w aukee County, and the rate of asthma - related emergency department visits is 1.5 times  higher in this community compared to the rest of the county.  Thus, smoke - free housing could  help to   reduce asthma triggers, improve indoor air quality ,   and   improve health outcomes   for  children and families in Westlawn and beyond.       Thank  you for proposing this important rule     it  has the potential to reduce health care costs,  save lives, and improve the quality of life for so many Americans.

      "    This pretty well destroys the Myth of second hand smoke:    Lungs from pack-a-day smokers safe for transplant, study finds.  By JoNel Aleccia, Staff Writer, NBC News.  Using lung transplants from heavy smokers may sound like a cruel joke, but a new study finds that organs taken from people who puffed a pack a day for more than 20 years are likely safe.  What's more, the analysis of lung transplant data from the U.S. between 2005 and 2011 confirms what transplant experts say they already know: For some patients on a crowded organ waiting list, lungs from smokers are better than none.  \"I think people are grateful just to have a shot at getting lungs,\" said Dr. Sharven Taghavi, a cardiovascular surgical resident at Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, who led the new study...........................  Ive done the math here and this is how it works out with second ahnd smoke and people inhaling it!  The 16 cities study conducted by the U.S. DEPT OF ENERGY and later by Oakridge National laboratories discovered:  Cigarette smoke, bartenders annual exposure to smoke rises, at most, to the equivalent of 6 cigarettes/year.  146,000 CIGARETTES SMOKED IN 20 YEARS AT 1 PACK A DAY.  A bartender would have to work in second hand smoke for 2433 years to get an equivalent dose.  Then the average non-smoker in a ventilated restaurant for an hour would have to go back and forth each day for 119,000 years to get an equivalent 20 years of smoking a pack a day! Pretty well impossible ehh!  .\n",

      "  I am an Executive Director of a small 20-unit housing authority of duplexes for elderly and those with a disability. We have residents who smoke inside and this rule will have a major impact on them. The most dramatic part of the Rule is the distance restriction of 25 feet. The Rule's restriction does not take into account that this is the individual's home. I understand restricting the smoking from inside but not the distance from buildings. Most of those who smoke will not change to smoke away from the building. I will probably lose most of those who do smoke. This is going to increase our expenses from move-outs and if we had a 25 feet restriction, we will need to build some type of structure so the resident doesn't have to smoke in the rain, snow, wind, etc. And this structure will be more than just 25 feet from some apartments so some residents will have a long distance to go smoke. I don't believe many of the smokers will remain in the program even though they need the housing assistance. Is that HUD's purpose? To get rid of all the smokers?   I'm not opposed to restricting the smoking inside buildings but the distance restriction is not going to work. Please remove that from your Rule.  \n",

The Westlawn Partnership for a Healthier Environment  is a group of community stakeholders  that   has met on a regular basis since 2008 to identify, prioritize, and address environmental  health concerns in the Westlawn community.  Located in northwest Milwaukee, Westlawn is   - subsidized housing development.     Milwauke e County ranks as the worst county in the State of Wisconsin for asthma - related  hospitalizations and emergency department visits.  Moreover, specific to  the  Westlawn   community , the rate of hospitalizations for asthma among children is nearly twice that of  Mi l w aukee County, and the rate of asthma - related emergency department visits is 1.5 times  higher in this community compared to the rest of the county.  Thus, smoke - free housing could  help to   reduce asthma triggers, improve indoor air quality ,   and   improve health outcomes   for  children and families in Westlawn and beyond.       Thank  you for proposing this important rule     it  has the potential to reduce health care costs,  save lives, and improve the quality of life for so many Americans.

      "  January 19, 2016       The Honorable Julián Castro   Secretary   Department of Housing and Urban Development   451 Seventh Street SW   Washington, DC 20410   Re: Instituting Smoke - Free Public H ousing; Docket No. FR 5597 - P - 02     Dear Secretary Castro:     On behalf of the Advocacy Council of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and  Immunology, we are pleased to submit this letter of support for the  proposed rule published in  the  Federal Register   on November 17, 2015 (Docket No. FR - 5597 - P - 02) on instituti ng smoke - free public housing.       Immunology, represents the interests of over 6,000 allergists/immunologists and allied health  professionals.  Its members are at the   front line of caring for individuals with asthma which  disproportionately impacts those living in urban areas, especially children.       Our organization   support s   th e proposed new rule  as we believe it could significantly  improve the  health of public housin g residents , particularly those suffering from  a sthma and allergies . The  publication of the proposed rule represents a major step forward in protecting the millions of  Americans who currently live in federally - owned public housing from the harms of tobacco ,  particularly second - hand smoke .  We urge HUD to adopt a final rule implementing this measure.     Secondhand smoke contains many poisons and cancer - causing chemicals, including nicotine,  carbon monoxide, ammonia, formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, nitrogen  oxides, phenol, sulfur  dioxi de, lead, and others. As such, s econd - hand smoke  poses health concerns for all individuals,  particularly children and pregnant women.     The re   are numerous  repor ts on the direct health effects of second - hand smoke  exposure. The  mo  The Health  Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke . The report details how even small  amounts of exposure can have serious health effects. S econd - hand smoke  can   exacerbate a wide  range of adverse health effects, including asthma.     Increased rates of lower respiratory illness, middle - ear infections, tonsillectomy and  adenoidectomy, cough, asthma and asthma exacerbations, hospitalizations have been  associated  with  second - hand smoke.   It has been estimated that  second - hand smoke   e xposure causes asthma             symptoms in  hundreds of thousands of children .    One study indicated that children with asthma  who were exposed to  second - hand smoke   had  additional co - morbid  condit ions including higher  levels of obesity and less healthcare usage compared with unexposed children. i     M aintaining a smoke - free  public housing environment   will undoubtedly   decrease  the exposure to  second - hand smoke for  a family   living in public housing.       Studies published in 2011 and 2012 confirmed that children who live in multi - unit housing have  significantly higher exposure to  second - hand smoke  than those who live in detached housing,  and that 15 million children aged 3 - 11 years were exposed to SHS, rep resenting the highest  prevalence of SHS exposure among all age groups.     U sing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES),  t he studies,  showed that   levels of cotinine, a chemical marker of nicotine in the blood, were significant ly  higher among children living in multi - unit housing  compared to  chil dren living in detached  housing . ii , iii     Therefore,  it appears that  the  best   way to fully protect children and adults who live in multi - family housing from second - hand exposure is to impleme nt building - wide smoke - free policies.     All people, regardless of income, should be able to enjoy healthy housing, free of  second - hand  smoke  and other dangerous conditions.     Public housing residents with health conditions including asthma, chronic obstructi ve pulmonary  disease (COPD) and heart disease, could see significant health improvements once they are no  longer exposed to second - hand smoke, which can exacerbate their diseases.  Children and infants  could also significantly benefit from reduced exposure   to second - hand smoke in the form of  fewer ear infections, asthma attacks and lung infections including bronchitis and pneumonia.     The Advocacy Council supports this proposed rule.

We have a l ong - standing commitment   to supporting programs and policies to  improve the health and well - being of vulnerable and underserved populations across the lifespan,  which includes low - income, racial/ethnic minority, and other populations (taking into account  ge nder, gender identity, culture, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, and  language)   at high risk for disease and other adverse health conditions 1 .   Reducing tobacco - related  disparities among health priority populations is one of our st rategic initiatives that  we address  primarily through awareness, professional education ,   and resource development 2 .     Research clearly demonstrates that tobacco is the leading caus e of preventable death in the  country across all populations 3   4 .  Vulnerable populations, however,  such as the poor, mentally  ill, racial/ethnic minority groups, persons living with HIV, LGBT persons,  and substance  abusing individuals are at increased ri sk for smoking - related illnesses because of higher exposure  to risks associated with smoking and lower availability of resources to combat smoking 5 .  For  example, second - hand smoke exposure is highest among African Americans (71%), people  living below the  poverty level (43.2%), children aged 3     11, and people living in rental housing  (36.8%) 6 .  African Americans are 20% more likely to have asthma and African American  children are 7 times more likely than non - Hispanic whites to die from asthma - related                                                                1   Public Interest Directorate, American Psychological Association.   http://www.apa.org/pi/   2   Health Disparities Initiative, Public Interest Directorate, American Psychological Association,  http://www.apa.org/to pics/health - disparities/initiative.aspx   3   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2015).  Cigarette smoking in the United States.  http://www .cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/resources/data/cigarette - smoking - in - united - states.html .     4    th   Anniversary, 1964     2014.  http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/priorities/tobacco/index.html   5    http://www.apa.org/topics/health - dispari ties/tobacco - meeting.aspx   6   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Second Hand Smoke Facts.  http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fac t_sheets/secondhand_smoke/general_facts/index.htm   2     morbi dities.  Asthma rates are higher in children exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke exposure  and children living below or near the poverty level 7 .  Stress related to discrimination and  stigmatization is associated with smoking among the LGBT community, person s living with HIV  communities, and among the poor 8   9 . Groups at the intersections of these social identities such as  poor African American children with asthma are at even greater risk for smoking relat ed  morbidities and mortality.   Access to easily  available, appropriate, high quality health care  including smoking cessation support is more dif ficult for these populations.   For these reasons,  the field has come to realize  that targeted attention is required to reduce smoking and its  consequences  in vulnerable, health priority   communities .     We are concerned that vulnerable populations dependent on public housing will be threatened  with the prospect of housing insecu rity, the loss of housing, or prolonged homelessness if the  proposed smoke - free rule is adopted.   At the same time, we are aware that the most effective  interventions to reduce smoking over the last 50 years have been public policies that have  prohibited  smoking and restric ted access to tobacco products.    Most of the people in public  housing are children (41%) and seniors (31%) 10   and most, like the majority of Americans, are  nonsmokers 11 . Moreover, similar to most smokers, those who do smoke want to quit.  W e  believe that the tenants in public housing, like other citizens, are entitled to a smoke - free  environment.     APA asks that HUD takes steps to ensure that the rule does not adversely impact HUD  participants.  Results from the implementation of voluntary sm oke - free policies in public  housing are promising and suggest that such policies can be successfully implemented without  creating unanticipated negative consequences for the residents 12 .   We strongly encourage that  safeguards are instituted to minimize the  threat of eviction due to violations of the rule and that  culturally appropriate smoking prevention programs and smoking cessation support and  resources are offered.  We recommend that best practices gleaned from the experiences of  previously implemented v oluntary programs be required for the implementation of this rule.        With these safeguards and support programs in place, APA supports the Housing and Urban   November 17,   2015: Instituting Smoke - Free Public Housing; Docket No. FR5597 - P - 02 RIN  2577 - AC97).  Such a rule will result in higher air quality, fewer fires, and fewer smoke   related  illnesses among the residents and employees.                                                                   7   Office of Minority Health, HHS.

      "        January  13, 201 6  The Honorable Julián Castro   Office of the  Secretary   U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development  Regulations Division, Office of General Counsel  Department  of Housing and Urban Development  451 7th Street SW, Room 10276  Washington, DC 20410 Œ0500  RE:  Instituting Smoke -Free Public Housing   Dear Secretary Castro:    On behalf of the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), which represents 120,900  family phys icians and medical students across the country,  I write in response to the  proposed  rule  titled, ﬁInstituting Smoke -Free Public Housingﬂ as published by the Department of Housin g and Urban Development (HUD) in the November 17, 2015  Federal Register .   Since t obacco use is documented as the leading preventable cause of death and illness in our  nation , the AAFP enthusiastically supports this proposal.  Nicotine, a key ingredient in tobacco  products, is addictive. Tobacco use by and around children and adolescents is of particular  concern due  to the  increased risk for addiction and passive exposure.  We  therefore  applaud  HUD for taking this important step  that will create additional smoke -free environments.  We also  appreciate that HUD accepted th e recommendation  to create this policy  that t he AAFP  and  other  organizations  called for  in a March 27, 2015  letter  that  advocated  that  all government  subsidized housing be made smoke -free.  This  historic  step will help  protect  the  public health , esp ecially  that  of children , in our nation™s most vulnerable populations.    We appreciate that HUD and the Department of Health and Human Service held and invited the  AAFP to the White House Smoke -Free Housing Summit that occurred on January 5, 2016. This  sum mit provided an important opportunity to discuss the health and economic benefits of the  proposed regulation . including that:   One in four nonsmokers is exposed to second -hand smoke.   Individuals  living in rental housing  suffer from a higher second -hand smok e exposure  rate .   There are 760,000 children living in public housing.  Secretary Castro   Page 2 of 2  January  13, 201 6    The proposed rule would impact 2 million people.    Those living in public housing may be exposed to nicotine levels that equal five   cigarettes.    The rate of respiratory illness is signif icantly higher among those living in public housing.   The proposed rule is e stimated to save $153 million due to health, safety and facility  damage costs .  Despite  the clear  evidence  about the dangers of smoking, the Centers for Disease Control and  Preventi on (CDC)  reports that cigarette smoking causes about one in five deaths in the United  States every year . The AAFP considers  this  as  unacceptable  and  the  proposed rule will help to  address the health hazard  of secondhand smoke .  The AAFP also supports the  proposed 25 foot buffer zone from entrances, exits, windows and  ventilation intakes of buildings  that HUD included  in the proposed rule . We believe t his buffer  zone will  help  assist with enforcement  of smoke -free public housing  by ensuring that  second  hand smoke  does not  drift back into living units from  the  outside  or r equire  individuals  to walk  through  second hand smoke  around entrances  or exits from buildings.    We call on HUD to include in the final rule the exclusion of electronic nicotine  delivery systems  and waterpipe tobacco (hookahs) in restricted areas and that the regulation should apply to all  government -subsidized housing rather than just all government -owned housing.   The AAFP also believes the final rule should call for government -subsidized housing authorities  to refer residents to Quit -line services since the U.S. Public Health Service has found that  combining FDA -approved quit smoking therapies with counseling services are the most effective  for successful quit attempts. The AAFP  recently updated Tobacco and Nicotine  online toolkit  and we encourage family physicians to integrate tobacco prevention and control efforts into th eir  office system and support a tobacco -free community.      The AAFP is committed to working with HUD to ensure that all residents of HUD -assisted  housing live in healthy environments.  For any questions you might have please contact Robert  Bennett, Federal  Regulatory Manager, at 202 -232-9033 or  rbennett@aafp.org .   Sincerely,     Robert L. Wergin, MD, FAAFP  Board Chair   \n",

Passa ge of this law substantially reduced  exposure with some dramatic health benefits.  A rec ent report released by the  Massachusetts Department of Public Health demonstra ted that there were 577 fewer than  expected heart attack deaths each year after the pa ssage of the smoke-free law. 1   Exposure in the home, however, remains a significan t threat to public health.  In the 2006  Report entitled  Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Toba cco Smoke , the  United States Surgeon General concluded that the ho me is ﬁa major location of  secondhand smoke exposure for adults.ﬂ The Report f ound that nonsmokers who are  exposed to secondhand smoke at home increase their  risk of developing lung cancer by  20% to 30% and their risk of heart disease by 25% t o 30%.      The Report also concluded that the ﬁhome is the pla ce where children are most exposed  to secondhand smoke.ﬂ Children exposed to secondhan d smoke are more likely to  develop bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma and ear infec tions. 2  In addition, secondhand  smoke has been linked to Sudden Infant Death Syndro me. 3  Given these proven health  consequences, it is not surprising that secondhand  smoke exposure causes a substantial  strain on private and public healthcare payers in M assachusetts.     In order to protect children and other vulnerable p opulations from exposure in the home,  the Massachusetts Tobacco Control Program launched  the Smoke-Free Families Initiative  in the winter of 2008.  Consisting of three major c omponents, the initiative strives to raise  awareness of secondhand smoke as an issue, integrat es that message in to existing  protocols within health and human service agencies  and encourages landlords and  property managers to adopt smoke-free policies with in their multi-unit buildings.  The  Public Health Advocacy Institute is leading the eff ort to increase the availability of  smoke-free housing in the Commonwealth.   While some people are able to avoid exposure by sim ply prohibiting smoking in their  homes, this solution may not be enough to protect r esidents of multi-unit buildings, as  secondhand smoke is often not contained inside an a partment or condominium unit.   Instead, the smoke seeps under doors, through venti lation ducts, wall chases, electrical  sockets, light fixtures, cracks in building walls o r other openings.  After seeping into  neighboring condominium units or apartments, second hand smoke can stay in the air for  hours, exposing nonsmokers and their families for l ong periods of time. 4        In order to provide accurate information on market  demand and other economic  rationales for smoke-free rules, the Public Health  Advocacy Institute conducted two  surveys in the summer of 2008.  The first of the tw o surveys measured the supply of and  demand for smoke-free multi-unit residential proper ties.  The second survey assessed the  experiences of landlords who have implemented smoke -free rules.  The findings of both  surveys are presented in this Report.     5 In general, the surveys reveal a strong demand for  smoke-free rules among residents of  multi-unit residential properties. (For purposes of  this Report, the phrase ﬁsmoke-free  ruleﬂ means a building-wide, no smoking rule that p rohibits smoking anywhere in or on  the property, except for designated smoking areas l ocated outside.)  Of the residents who  reside in smoke-free properties, 91% support the ru le, and just 2% oppose it.  Among  residents that live in buildings where smoking is c urrently allowed, 61% would support  the immediate implementation of a no smoking rule,  and approximately 75% would  support the change or remain neutral.  The demand i s largely consistent across age,  educational status, income level and housing type.       Despite the demand, however, just over 29% of multi -unit residential properties are  smoke-free.  The substantial gap between demand and  supply suggests that landlords and  condominium associations are in a position to benef it by going smoke-free.  Indeed, in  the survey of landlords, nearly all of the responde nts who had implemented a smoke-free  rule reported that it decreased their operating cos ts, increased demand for their properties  and was easy to implement and enforce.  Given the p otential benefits, it would not be  surprising if Massachusetts experienced a substanti al increase of smoke-free multi-unit  housing.                                               6 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND   KEY FINDINGS   SURVEY OF RESIDENTS OF MULTI-UNIT PROPERTIES IN   MASSACHUSETTS   A 2008 telephonic survey conducted by the Public He alth Advocacy Institute reveals a  strong demand for smoke-free rules among the reside nts of multi-unit properties in  Massachusetts.  Smoke-free rules prohibit smoking e verywhere in an apartment building  or condominium, except for designated smoking areas  located outside.  Smoke-free rules  are intended to prevent secondhand smoke from drift ing from one apartment or  condominium unit to another, and thus, prevent invo luntary exposure.  Smokers may live  in the building under a smoke-free rule and often d o reside in these properties.  They are  simply required to refrain from smoking, except in  designated smoking areas located  outside.      The Survey was funded by the Massachusetts Departme nt of Public Health and  administered by SurveyUSA Ž between June 20th and June 26th, 2008.  The survey   includes 1,304 interviews with residents of multi-u nit properties in Amherst, Cambridge,  Brookline, Easthampton, Hadley, Jamaica Plain, Newt on, Northampton, Somerville,  Southampton and Watertown.  The questionnaire scree ned respondents to ensure that  they resided in a multi-unit rental property or con dominium before asking questions  designed to measure demand for smoke-free rules.  T he Survey revealed the following  key findings:    Ł 75% of residents who do not currently live in a s moke-free building would  support the immediate implementation of a no smokin g rule or remain neutral.   The level of support would likely be even higher if  the rule were phased in  over the period of a year.    Ł Of the residents who currently live in a smoke-fr ee multi-unit building, 91%  support the rule.  Just 2% are opposed.  Ł 81% of prospective residents are immediately less  interested in an apartment  or condominium unit if they smell tobacco smoke whe n looking at it.     Ł 43% of residents are willing to pay more to live  in a smoke-free building.  Of  these residents who are willing to pay more, 26% ar e willing to pay 20%  more, and 63% are willing to pay 10% more.     Ł 69% of residents of multi-unit properties are mor e interested in knowing up  front, in the property listing that an apartment or  condominium unit is located  in smoke-free building.  Fewer than 20% feel this l isting information would  make no difference in their decision.    Ł The levels of support and demand are widely held,  remaining consistent  across gender, age, educational status, income leve l and housing type    7 SURVEY OF LANDLORDS OF MULTI-UNIT RESIDENTIAL RENTA L  PROPERTIES    A 2008 survey by the Public Health Advocacy Institu te reveals that 99% of landlords  who had implemented a smoke-free rule felt it was a  good decision.  The respondents  reported that implementing the rule increased deman d for their property and decreased  their operating costs.  Two-page questionnaires wer e mailed to 6,809 landlords in  Amherst, Cambridge, Brookline, Easthampton, Hadley,  Jamaica Plain, Newton,  Northampton, Somerville, Southampton and Watertown.   Mailing lists were provided by  the assessor™s office in each municipality.  Althou gh not necessarily representative of  landlords in general, the following are the key fin dings from the survey:           Ł 99% of the landlords who had implemented a smoke- free rule felt it was a  good decision.    Ł 66% of the landlords reported having to pay $100  or more extra in smoking- related maintenance costs per apartment compared to  an apartment where  smoking was not allowed.  33% expended more than $5 00 extra.   Ł   7% of the landlords reported that secondhand sm oke has triggered fire alarms.   Ł 5% of the landlords report that smoking caused a  fire in one or more of their  residential rental properties.   Ł 39% of the landlords who had implemented a smoke- free rule reported that it  decreased the number of disputes among tenants, and  54% reported no effect  on disputes.  Ł 90% of the landlords who had implemented a smoke- free rule reported that  implementation was easy or very easy.   Ł 93.3% of the landlords who had implemented a smok e-free rule reported that  the rule was virtually self-enforcing, the same as  enforcing any other rule or  easy to enforce.  Only 6.7% reported encountering d ifficulty in enforcement.     Ł 15% of the landlords who had implemented a smoke- free rule reported that it  decreased their vacancy rates, and 77% reported no  effect on vacancy rates.  Ł 19% of the landlords who had implemented a smoke- free rule reported that it  decreased their turnover rates, and 78% report no e ffect on turnover rates.    Ł 49% of the landlords reported that a smoke-free r ule decreased their potential  legal liability, and 42% reported no effect.   Despite the apparent benefits of implementing a smo ke-free rule, only 29% of multi-unit  properties the survey region are smoke-free.  The d ifference suggests that there may be  barriers for the implementation of smoke-free rules .  One potential barrier is the  misperception that smoke-free rules are or may be i llegal.  Among landlords who had not  implemented a smoke-free rule, 19.4% believed that  a smoke-free rule was illegal, and  35.8% were unsure of the legality.       8 METHODOLOGY   RESEARCH OBJECTIVES    Ł  Gauge the interest in, and market demand for, sm oke-free rules in multi-unit  properties (including residential rental properties  and condominiums).   Ł  Measure the percentage of the multi-unit housing  stock with smoke-free rules.   Ł  Assess the experiences of landlords in implement ing smoke-free rules.   Ł  Evaluate potential barriers for implementation o f smoke-free rules.     RESEARCH DESIGN       To accomplish the objectives outlined above, the Pu blic Health Advocacy Institute  conducted two surveys: an automated, random telepho nic survey administered by  SurveyUSA Ž of 1,304 residents in multi-unit dwellings, and a  written survey mailed to  6,809 landlords with a response rate of 5.5 percent  (or 372 completed surveys).      Three geographic regions in Massachusetts were sele cted for the two surveys. The first  region was comprised of Cambridge, Somerville and W atertown.  The second region was  comprised of Brookline, Newton and the Jamaica Plai n area of Boston.  The third region  was comprised of Amherst, Easthampton, Hadley, Nort hampton and Southampton.     The regions were selected due to their high demand  for housing and large inventory of  multi-unit residential properties. The demand for a nd supply of multi-unit housing in  each region was determined by analyzing the 2000 Fe deral Census, various housing  surveys and community assessments were conducted.   Interviews of area real estate  brokers were also completed.   The telephonic surveys were administered by SurveyU SA. Ž  Each survey was limited to  area codes that cover one or more of survey regions .  To confirm that the respondent  actually resided in the geographic region, initial  screening questions were included. The  telephonic surveys were administered separately by  region using Interactive Voice  Technology Ž between June 20, 2008 and June 26, 2008.    The results of the three regions were then combined .  To adjust for differences in the  sample size for each region, three adjustment weigh tings based on the total number of  adults in the region who lived in multi-unit housin g were generated.  The appropriate  adjustment weighting was then multiplied by the ind ividual respondent weightings  provided by SurveyUSA Ž.     The mail survey was administered by the Public Heal th Advocacy Institute.  Mailing  information for landlords was obtained from municip al assessors™ offices.  If an  individual landlord had more than one listing, the  extra listings were purged to avoid   9 duplicate copies being sent to a single individual.   Next, the listings were randomized.  Lastly, approximately the first 6,800 listings were  chosen, which was the maximum  number of mailings that could be accommodated under  our budget.     Each mailing consisted of a two-page questionnaire  printed on the front and back of a  single sheet of paper, along with instructions on c ompleting the survey.  To encourage  responses, a drawing for a $500 retail gift certifi cate was offered.  The surveys were  mailed June 30, 2008, and responses were required t o be postmarked by July 25, 2008.       QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGN:     The questionnaire was designed by the Public Health  Advocacy Institute with input from  the Massachusetts Tobacco Control Program and Surve yUSA. Ž  The design process was  informed by reviewing secondhand smoke attitudinal  surveys used in other states and  other surveys measuring demographic information com monly included in smoking and  health related surveys.      After screening for eligibility, the resident quest ionnaire identified respondents™ exact  housing type, smoking habits, the smoking habits of  household members and the  awareness of secondhand smoke as a danger.  The rem ainder of the questionnaire was  designed to accomplish the objectives outlined abov e.  The questionnaire also gathered  general demographic information, which was collecte d to document future attitudinal  shifts within demographic groups and to ensure surv ey accuracy, which was achieved by  comparing data collected here with the demographic  data from the 2000 Federal Census.     As the method used to develop the landlord mailing  list narrowed the field to only  eligible respondents, the questionnaire included on ly one screening question to verify  eligibility.  The questionnaire then identified the  total number of residential rental  properties owned by the respondent and the average  size of the properties.  The  remainder of the questionnaire was designed to achi eve the objectives outlined above.                                                  10  RESEARCH RESULTS AND DICUSSION     I. RESPONDENT COMPOSITION IN SURVEY RESIDENTS OF  MULTI-UNIT PROPERTIES     Residents of multi-unit rental properties and condo miniums located in any of the three  survey regions were eligible as respondents.  Combi ned, the three regions include the  municipalities of Amherst, Cambridge, Brookline, Ea sthampton, Hadley, Jamaica Plain,  Newton, Northampton, Somerville, Southampton and Wa tertown.     If the respondent was either a landlord in the prop erty where he resided, or if the  respondent owned more than one-half of the units in  the condominium where he lived, he  was excluded from completing the full questionnaire . These otherwise eligible  respondents were excluded because we felt that thei r opinions would likely deviate  significantly from that of most residents of multi- unit properties, and therefore, tend not  to accurately reflect market demand.      Also excluded were respondents residing in college  dormitories or other housing  provided by a college or university.  We believed m ost respondents living in this type of  housing are not familiar with the conditions, prici ng and policies of market rate multi-unit  housing in Massachusetts.  College students and col lege-age individuals who resided off  campus were, however, eligible to complete the enti re survey unless more than three such  individuals lived in the same apartment or condomin ium unit.    Tables 1A, 1B and 1C display general demographic in formation on residents who  completed the full questionnaire.  The demographic  information in these three tables  closely tracks data available from the 2000 Federal  Census, which suggests an accurate  sampling was achieved.                                        TABLE 1A  Gender and Age of Respondents  Gender  Age  Male Female 18-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55-64 65+  45.3% 54.7% 12.1% 38.7% 16.9% 12.3% 8.5% 11.7%  TABLE 1B  Education and Income of Respondents  Education  Income  College + College Some College No College  < $60K >  $60K  53.1% 21.7% 15.2% 9.9% 49.6% 50.4%   11                         The prevalence of smoking-related health conditions  among residents and those who  share a household with residents were measured.  We  felt that residents who have (or live  with someone who has) one of these conditions would  tend to avoid exposure to  secondhand smoke by living in smoke-free properties .  Prevalence rates among the  survey respondents are displayed in Table 1D.  Thes e health conditions were chosen  because they are, according to the 2006 Surgeon Gen eral™s Report  The Health  Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smo ke,  some of the most common  smoking-related health conditions.       The residents™ smoking behavior was also measured,  as we expected residents who  smoke would tend to avoid properties with smoke-fre e rules.  Phrasing for the questions  on smoking behavior were taken from the Massachuset ts Behavior Risk Statewide  Survey, which measures, among other health risk fac tors, smoking status. The prevalence  rates among survey respondents are displayed in Tab le 1E.  In comparison, the statewide  average for current smokers is 16.4%. 5                  The resident™s perception of the danger of secondha nd smoke was also assessed, as we  felt that residents who are aware of the health eff ects of secondhand smoke are more  likely to avoid exposure by living in smoke-free pr operties.  The perception of residents  about secondhand smoke is displayed in Table 1G.

This  inconsistency is discussed in the following section .          II. CURRENT INVENTORY OF SMOKE-FREE MULTI-UNIT  RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES IN MASSACHUSETTS     One factor in assessing market demand for smoke-fre e housing is the current supply of  residential properties with smoke-free rules. We ga thered information on smoking rules  by asking the following question:    ﬁIn the building where you live, is smoking allowed  in both common areas  and inside individual apartments? Is smoking allowe d only in individual  units? Or is smoking not allowed in the building at  all?ﬂ     Respondents were not afforded the opportunity to an swer ﬁNot Sure.ﬂ  By excluding this  option, we intended to encourage respondents, even  those who might be unfamiliar with  the smoking-related rules of their buildings, to ma ke a best guess.      Results indicated that only 28.7% of residents are  covered by a smoke-free rule.  This  percentage is interpreted as meaning that approxima tely 28.7% of multi-unit residential  properties in the survey area are smoke-free.  The  percentage is largely consistent across  the demographic range, including gender, age and in come, as indicated in Table 2A.    TABLE 2A  Smoking-Related Rules  Gender  Age Income   Male Female  18-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55-64 65-74 <$60K >$60K  100% No smoking  27.2% 29.9% 47.2% 27.9% 25% 23.9%  25% 22.1% 29.5% 28.3%  No smoking in   Common Areas   40.2% 42.6% 25.2% 44.5% 46.4% 40.9% 44.6% 42.9% 39. 6% 43.4%  No Related Rules 32.6% 27.5% 27.7% 27.5% 28.6% 35.2 % 30.4% 35.1% 30.8% 28.3%    Given a higher smoking prevalence among 18-24 year  olds, as compared to other age  groups,  6  it is somewhat surprising that the group was also  more likely than other  respondents to live in a smoke-free building.  In r esponse to the question of whether they  smoke cigarettes every day, 18-24 year olds respond ed ﬁYesﬂ nearly twice as often as any  other age group.  The finding is suggestive that ev en smokers, at least those aged 18-24,  will not avoid living in properties with smoke-free  rules.   TABLE 1G  Respondents™ Perception of Secondhand Smoke Exposur e  Very   Harmful  Somewhat   Harmful  Minor   Nuisance  Not   Harmful   Not Sure   66.7% 25.4% 5% 1.9% 1%   13     Information on resident education level and the exi stence of a smoke-free rule is shown  in Table 2B.  As educational level negatively corre lates with smoking status in general,  7  it is not surprising that the survey found that res idents with higher education levels were  more likely to reside in a smoke-free building.       Also presented in Table 2B is data on the existence  of smoke-free rules across three types  of multi-unit housing type. Just over 52% of smoke- free properties consisted of houses  that had been divided into apartments.  The fact th at divided houses tend to be owner- occupied may suggests that owners tend to establish  smoke-free rules to avoid exposing  themselves.  Additionally, the passive ventilation  common to divided houses can  contribute to drifting secondhand smoke.  Unlike ac tive ventilations systems used in  larger buildings to service individual apartments o r condominium units, passive  ventilation relies on air moving through doorways,  hallways and stairways throughout the  entire building.  (It should be noted that drifting  secondhand smoke also occurs in many  types of active ventilation systems.)     Another factor that potentially influences the occu rrence of smoke-free rules is the  implementation process. For landlords or property m anagers, the implementation process  is easy.  They can decide unilaterally to institute  a smoke-free rule.  When they decided  to do so, they typically phase in the new smoke-fre e rule during lease renewal or when  new tenants sign their lease, which means that a pr operty will be smoke-free in one year.   Where tenants have month-to-month leases, otherwise  known as a tenancies-at-will, the  property will be smoke-free in about a month.  By c ontrast, making a condominium  smoke-free is slightly more complicated.  Making a  condominium smoke-free requires a  vote of unit owners.  Typically, 75% or more of uni t owners must vote in support of the  rule change.  (Trustees can make their condominium™ s common areas smoke-free without  a vote of unit owners.)

DEMAND FOR SMOKE-FREE MULTI-UNIT RESIDENTIAL  PROPERTIES   The survey assessed the effect of providing prospec tive residents with information up  front in a property listing on whether an apartment  or condominium unit is located in a  smoke-free building.  Over 69% of prospective resid ents are more interested in a property  listing in a smoke-free building.  In total, 80% of  prospective residents are more  interested in knowing in a listing whether or not t he apartment or condominium unit is in  a smoke-free building.      Additionally, this level of interest is consistent  across a broad range of prospective  residents.  Table 3A displays the levels of interes t by gender, age and income level.  In all  cases, the majority of prospective residents would  be more interested in knowing the  smoking policy in the listing.         TABLE 3A  Demand for Smoking-Related Listing Information  Gender Age Income   Male Female 18-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55-64 65-74 <$6 0K >$60K  More  Interested  70.2% 68.5% 54.7% 71.5% 74.5% 65.2% 68.5% 70.5% 67%  71.8%  Less  Interested  10.3% 12.1% 15.7% 9.2% 11.4% 14.9% 11.7% 11.5% 14.8 % 7.4%  No   Difference  18.4% 17.8% 28.9% 18.1% 13.2% 16.1% 18.9% 17.9% 17. 4% 19.1%  Not Sure 1% 1.5% .6% 1.2% .9% 3.7% .9% 0% .8% 1.6%   Table 3B similarly shows a consistent level of inte rest across educational level and  housing type.  Indeed, in nearly ever demographic b reakdown shown in Tables 3A and  3B, three-quarters or more of the prospective resid ents would prefer property listings to  include information on whether the building is smok e-free or not.  The only two  exceptions are residents who are 18-24 years of age  and residents with no college  education.  Yet, even among these two groups, appro ximately 70% would prefer to have  smoking information in the property listing.            15   TABLE 3B  Demand for Smoking-Related Listing Information  Education  Housing Type   College &   Graduate   School    College  Some    College  No College  House   Divided into   Apartments  Apartment   Building  Condominium  More  Interested  77.1% 67.6% 59.4% 47.7% 67.7% 67.3% 73.3%  Less  Interested  7.8% 8.5% 16.8% 26.6% 11.3% 12.7% 9.1%  No   Difference  14.3% 22.1% 21.8% 25% 19.5% 19.2% 16%  Not Sure .7% 1.8% 2% .8% 1.5% .9% 1.6%   The prospective resident™s willingness to pay more  to rent an apartment or purchase a  condominium unit in a smoke-building was also asses sed in the survey. Over 43% of  prospective residents would be willing, in general,  to pay more.  Of those willing to pay  more, 25% would pay 20% more and 75% would be willi ng to pay 10% more.  As shown  in Tables 3C and 3D, the willingness to pay more is  relatively consistent across the  various demographic breakdowns.      The prospective resident may be willing to pay more  to avoid the possibility of prolonged  exposure to secondhand smoke or the potential of ha ving to relocate, if the exposure is  not remedied.  For prospective a condominium owner,  the transaction cost of relocating  can be substantial because it potentially involves  selling his or her unit.

As shown in tables  3E and 3F, the majority of  prospective residents are immediately less interest ed in a property if they smell tobacco   16  smoke.  This reaction is relatively consistent acro ss gender, income level, age and  housing type.

RESIDENT SUPPORT FOR SMOKE-FREE RULES    When asked how they felt about living in a building  that is entirely smoke-free,  91% of residents indicated that they supported it.   Just 2% opposed it.  As shown in  Tables 4A and 4B, this level of support is relative ly consistent across gender, income  level, age, housing type and education level.

Of residents who are not currently living in a smok e-free property, over 74% would  support the immediate implementation of a smoke-fre e rule or remain neutral on the  issue.  As shown in tables 4C and 4D, the level of  support remains fairly consistent across  a range of demographics.

The difference  may be attributable to the fact that  the rule change shown in Tables 4C and 4D would be  implemented immediately.  In  practice, landlords and property managers can imple ment smoke-free rules over the  period of several months or a year, giving resident s a chance to adjust to the rule or, for  some residents, the chance to make alternative arra ngements, should they wish to  relocate.  However, once the rule is implemented, t he levels of support shown in Tables  4A and 4B are what landlords, property managers and  condominium trustees should  expect.             V. RESPONDENT CHARACTERISTICS IN SURVEY OF  LANDLORDS     An assessment of landlords and property managers™ a ttitudes towards smoke-free rules  was also conducted in this Survey.  Landlords and p roperty managers with properties  located the municipalities of Amherst, Cambridge, B rookline, Easthampton, Hadley,  Jamaica Plain, Newton, Northampton, Somerville, Sou thampton and Watertown were  eligible.  Listings of landlords and property manag ers were obtained from municipal  assessors™ offices.  Given that survey response rat e was 5.5%, the results are not  necessarily representative of landlord experiences  in general.       The number of units managed or owned by each respon dent is shown in Table 5A.  Just  over 84% of respondents managed 5 or fewer units, c lassifying them as small landlords.    Over 90% of respondents managed their own propertie s, as opposed to 9.4% who  retained employees or contractors to manage their p roperties.   * The respondents who had 10 or more units make up  approximately 10% of the total number of respondent s.    The percentage of respondents who have implemented  a smoke-free rule is displayed in  Table 5B.  Note that Table 5B does not accurately r eflect the percentage of the multi-unit  housing stock in the survey region with smoke-free  rules.  The survey of landlords was  not intended to provide this measurement.  As discu ssed in Section II of this Report, the  actual percentage is 28.7%.

LANDLORDS™ EXPERIENCES WITH AND PERCEPTION  OF SMOKE-FREE RULES    Over 99% of all of the respondents who had actually  implemented a smoke-free rule  believed that it was a ﬁgood decision.ﬂ  For mainte nance costs, 65% of respondents  reported having to pay $100 or more extra in smokin g-related maintenance costs per  apartment when compared to an apartment where smoki ng was not allowed.  Over 19%  reported paying $100 to $300 extra, 14% reported pa ying $300 to $500 extra and 33%  reported paying more than $500 extra. Typical repai rs include patching or replacing  carpets, linoleum countertops and linoleum flooring  with cigarette burn.  Landlords also  report having to abate the odor of tobacco smoke an d repaint yellow stains in walls and  ceilings.    Table 6A shows how implementation of smoke-free rul es affected the respondents™ rental  property businesses.  The phrase ﬁvacancy rateﬂ in  Table 6A means the average number  of available units that are not rented throughout t he year.  The phrase ﬁturnover rateﬂ  means how often existing tenants are replaced by ne w tenants.  To maximize profits,  landlords want to achieve the lowest possible rates  of occurrence for all of the variables  shown in Table 6A.    TABLE 6A  Effect of Smoke-free Rule on Rental Business for La ndlords Who Had Implemented a Smoke-Free Rule   Vacancy   Rate  Turnover   Rate  Disputes   Over   Security   Deposits  Resources  Required to  Manage  Disputes   Between   Tenants  Potential   Legal   Liability   Maintenance/  Repair Costs  Risk of   Fire  Increase 6.7% 3.6% 7.3% 8.3% 6.7% 8.5% 9.2% 9.6%  No   Change  77.4% 77.7% 64.6% 57.8% 54.4% 42.3% 29.7% 73.1%  Decrease 15.9% 18.7% 28.1% 33.9% 38.9% 49.2% 61% 17 .3%         Table 6B displays the perceived benefit of implemen ting a smoke-free rule by landlords  who had not implemented such rules.

O ver 4.5% reported that smoking had  caused a fire in one or more of their properties.     20  Although there is a high demand for smoke-free prop erties, only 28.7% of the multi-unit  housing stock is currently smoke-free.  The apparen t gap between the supply and demand  for smoke-free properties may suggest that there ar e barriers to change.  One of the  potential barriers is the perception that implement ation is difficult.  However, the survey  found that the opposite was true.  As shown in Tabl e 6C, over 90% of landlords who had  implemented a rule reported that implementation was  easy or very easy.  Landlords  generally phase in smoke-free rules when existing l eases renew and new tenants sign  their leases. In properties with month-to-month ten ants, otherwise known as tenancies-at- will, the implementation period can be as short as  one month.       TABLE 6C  Implementation of Rule   Very Difficult Difficult  Easy  Very Easy  3.6% 6.1% 37.2% 53.1%         Another potential barrier is the perception that en forcement would be difficult.   Landlords are very likely to weigh the difficulty o f enforcing a new rule against its  purported benefits.  If enforcement of a rule would  be too difficult, time consuming or  expensive, a landlord is less likely to use it.  As  shown in Table 6D, over 93% of  landlords who had implemented a rule did not find i t difficult.    TABLE 6D  Difficulty of Enforcement   Difficult  Easy  Same as other   rules  Virtually Self   Enforcing   6.7% 20.1% 23.2% 50%         Furthermore, landlords may incorrectly believe that  instituting a smoke-free rule is either  illegal or legally questionable. (It should be note d that it is entirely legal to make rental  properties smoke-free.)  As shown in Table 6E, 76.5 % of landlords who implemented a  rule believed it was legal.  As shown in table 6F,  only 44.8% of landlords who have not  implemented a rule held the same belief.    TABLE 6E  Perceived Legality of Rule of Landlords Who Had Imp lemented a Smoke-Free Rule  Legal  Not Legal   Some Units Must   Be Designated for   Smoking  Not Sure  76.5% 3% 2% 18.5%         TABLE 6F  Perceived Legality of Rule of Landlords Who Had Not  Implemented a Smoke-Free  Rule  Legal  Not Legal   Some Units Must   Be Designated for   Smoking  Not Sure  44.8% 18.2% 1.2% 35.8%    21  CONCLUSION   This Report provides several economic reasons for g oing smoke-free.  First, there is a  strong demand among residents for apartments and co ndominium units located in smoke- free buildings.   Second, relatively few properties  are currently smoke-free, which  suggests that the demand for smoke-free properties  is largely unmet.  Lastly, smoke-free  rules appear to reduce the operating costs of resid ential rental businesses.      Another important reason for going smoke-free is th e dramatic health effects caused by  exposure to secondhand smoke.  The owners and manag ers of multi-unit residential  properties provide housing for a large segment of o ur population.  Accordingly, they  make decisions that dramatically affect the public™  health.  By going smoke-free,  landlords and property managers will help reduce se condhand smoke-related diseases.

APPENDIX    The Appendix redisplays all of the tables of this  report with the number of  respondents (ﬁNﬂ) included.  The percentages of the  total population surveyed for this  study (1,304 interviews) are accurate by a margin o f plus or minus approximatley1.5 to  2.5 percentage points at the 95% confidence level.   Sampling tolerances vary depending  on the size of the subgroup analyzed as well as the  percentage of respondents giving a  particular response.  The table directly below indi cates the sampling tolerances for the  total sample and for subgroups of various sizes at  different percentages.  These tolerances  reflect error due to sampling error, and do not ref lect error due to other factors.

Strong tobacco control policies at the state level can help reduce the burden of tobacco use.  Saving Lives, Saving Money: A State-By-State Report on the Health and Economic Benefits of Comprehensive Smoke-Free Laws, provides new information about  the public health and economic benefits to states that implement smoke-free laws.  Comprehensive smoke-free laws reduce exposure to secondhand smoke, encourage people to quit or cut down on smoking, and prevent  youth from starting to smoke. As these laws reduce smoking and secondhand smoke exposure, data show that they reduce disease and  heath care spending, and they improve employee productivity.   The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN) commissioned leading experts to derive updated and expanded estimates for the public health benefits and economic savings in the 27 states that currently do not have a comprehensive smoke-free law in place.  The estimates show that in each of these states, a smoke-free law would result in fewer smokers, fewer smoking-related deaths, and fewer   youth who become smokers. In addition, a comprehensive smoke-free law in each state would substantially reduce health care costs associ ated with several smoking-related diseases.  SAVING LIVES  The data show that comprehensive smoke-free laws would decrease the number of adult smokers by tens of thousands in many states.   North Carolina, for example, would have 78,100 fewer adult smokers by adopting a comprehensive law that closed the current loophole   that allows smoking in non-hospitality workplaces. The results also show that nearly 400,000 fewer young people would become smokers if   states without a comprehensive smoke-free law adopted one, further reducing the health and economic burden of smoking. The reduction   in smoking-related deaths avoided by implementing smoke-free laws ranges from several hundred in states with smaller populations to more   than 110,000 in Texas. Non-smokersÕ deaths would be prevented in every state that applies a smoke-free law. If each of the 27 states without   a comprehensive smoke-free law had such a law in place, the following estimates of public health benefits would apply:  Adults Who Would Quit Smoking  Youth Who Would  Never Start Smoking Reduction in Smoking-Related Deaths Reduction in Deaths of Non-smokers 1.03M 398,700 624,000 69,500 SAVING MONEY  The total estimated savings in health care costs from adopting comprehensive smoke-free laws adds up to tens or hundreds of millions of   dollars in most states. Seven states would each save at least $80 million in spending on lung cancer, heart attacks and strokes, and pregnancy   complications over five years. All together, the 27 states without a comprehensive smoke-free law currently in place could save an estimated   $1.32 billion in treatment of those conditions over five years.  Lung CancerTreatment Savings  Heart Attack and Stroke  Treatment Savings  States' Medicaid Program Savings Smoking-RelatedPregnancy Treatment Savings  $316.11M $875.57M $42.79M $128.26M Figures represent savings for both smokers and non-smokers. 2 American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network Savings Lives, Saving Money: A State-By-State Report on the Health and Economic Benefits of Comprehensive Smoke-Free Laws                                                   WHAT STATES CAN DO  There is still much work to be done Ð 27 states have no statewide smoke-free  law in effect or have a law that does not cover all workplaces or populations.   Hospitality and casino workers, who studies show are exposed to dangerous second  hand smoke on the job, continue to be denied their right to breathe smoke-free   air in a large number of states. Opponents of smoke-free legislation continually   battle to weaken existing laws through loopholes and exemptions, further   complicating efforts to achieve the benefits of these laws. States in which some   residents are covered by city or county smoke-free laws would see greater health and   economic outcomes if a strong, comprehensive statewide law were implemented.  ACS CAN recommends that all states aim for statewide laws that are compre hensive and protect all workers from the dangers of secondhand smoke.  ¥ Smoke-free laws should cover  all workplaces. ¥ Venues should be  100 percent smoke-free with no exceptions , such as allowing smoking in certain places or at certain times. ¥ Statewide smoke-free laws should  not preempt local authorities from enacting stronger smoke-free laws in their jurisdictions.  American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network  Savings Lives, Saving Money: A State-By-State Report on the Health and Economic Benefits of Comprehensive Smoke-Free Laws 3                                                                                                                                                                   Intr TobaccoÕs burden on public health and the economy in the United States is well known. There are hundreds of thousands of premature  deaths, hundreds of billions of dollars in medical care and productivity losses each year, and more than 1,000 people start smoking every day.  Implementing strong tobacco control policies in the states has been proven to reduce smoking and discourage new smokers. Through a  three-pronged approach Ð higher tobacco taxes, comprehensive smoke-free laws, and fully funded tobacco prevention and cessation pro grams Ð experience and evidence show that state tobacco control policies can help curb the tobacco burden on this country.  In his 2006 report on the public health impact of tobacco use, U.S. Surgeon General Richard Carmona concluded that there is  no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. Evidence shows that smoke-free laws reduce exposure to secondhand smoke, encourage people to quit  or cut down on smoking, and prevent youth from starting to smoke. As these laws reduce smoking and secondhand smoke exposure, they  reduce disease, heath care spending, and improve employee productivity.   To better understand the power of comprehensive smoke-free policies, researchers have created models to measure the health and economic  benefits to states that implement smoke-free laws. Measuring the benefits of these policies can be complex, but the results are critical for  demonstrating just how many deaths can be prevented and how much money can be saved.  ABOUT THIS REPORT  This report provides new information about the public health and economic benefits to states from comprehensive smoke-free laws that   cover bars, restaurants, and workplaces. Twenty-seven states lacked comprehensive smoke-free laws as of June 1, 2011. This report focuses   on the public health and economic benefits if those states were to adopt comprehensive smoke-free laws. The report also looks at states   that do have a comprehensive smoke-free law in place and details critical actions that are still needed to protect and enforce the laws.  The first part of the report describes the dramatic impact that would result if comprehensive smoke-free laws were passed in every state nationwide.  This includes public health benefits, such as reductions in smoking and smoking-related deaths, as well as cost savings through reduced  spending on treating lung cancer and other diseases, caring for pregnant smokers, and reducing expenditures in state Medicaid programs.   The second half of the report includes a breakdown of the health and economic benefits that a comprehensive smoke-free law would bring to   those states without one in effect. For those states where a comprehensive law is currently in place, the information includes the population   covered by the law, examples of how the law has been successful, and potentially weak areas of the law, or loopholes that still should be   closed in order to fully protect people in the state.  The estimates in this report were calculated for ACS CAN using the most up-to-date economic and public health research and methodology.  In estimating the changes to the overall health of the population, the findings are based on standard assumptions about how tobacco users  react to changes in tobacco prices and laws around tobacco use, how these policies reduce the number of youth who become regular smokers,   and the most recent health data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on the percentage of smokers who would be   expected to die prematurely from smoking. Similarly, in estimating the cost savings to states from tobacco control policies, the report used the   latest studies and data on the costs of smoking-related disease and the savings to states without the burden of treating lung cancers, heart   attacks, and strokes related to smoking. The methodology and assumptions used to calculate the estimates are detailed in the Methodology  These estimates will change slightly each year, because the data are based on current tobacco control policies, as well as variables such as  population, local laws, and health care costs that can change over time. 1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network Savings Lives, Saving Money: A State-By-State Report on the Health and Economic Benefits of Comprehensive Smoke-Free Laws 4                                                                                                                                                                      Smoke-free laws improve public health by reducing exposure to cancer- causing pollutants and by lowering the incidence of chronic disease.   These laws also encourage smokers to quit and reduce consumption of   cigarettes, preventing disease and premature death. The greatest public   health benefits are achieved with a strong and broad smoke-free law that   covers all types of workplaces, bars, and restaurants Ð including gaming   facilities, correctional facilities, and retail environments, such as cigar bars,   with no exemptions. Young people are less likely to start smoking when smoke-free laws are in  place. Preventing youth initiation of smoking is a critical factor in reducing  smoking and related death and disease.  Smoke-free laws do not just prevent premature deaths in smokers, but also in people who are exposed to secondhand smoke and are at risk   for developing smoking-related disease. Secondhand smoke causes nearly 49,000 deaths each year from cancer and heart disease nation wide.1 Comprehensive laws can dramatically reduce this death toll.  As of June 1, 2011, 27 states did not have a comprehensive smoke-free law. Fifteen of these states have no smoke-free law in place that applies   to all workplaces or restaurants or bars. Twelve additional states do not cover all three types of venues, or they have substantial loopholes that  weaken the impact of the law. In each of these states, a comprehensive smoke-free law would considerably improve public health. If each of   the 27 states without a comprehensive smoke-free law had such a law in place, the following estimates of public health benefits would apply:  Adults Who Would Quit Smoking  Youth Who Would  Never Start Smoking Reduction in Smoking-Related Deaths Reduction in Deaths of Non-smokers 1.03M 398,700 624,000 69,500 REDUCTIONS IN SMOKERS Several states would reduce the number of smokers by tens of thousands by implementing comprehensive smoke-free laws. Some smokers  would stop immediately, but overall smoking rates would decline over time. Each state without a comprehensive smoke-free law would have   fewer smokers and fewer future smokers. North Carolina, for example, would reduce the number of adult smokers by 78,100 by closing its   existing loophole for non-hospitality workplaces. Florida would reduce the number of adult smokers by 23,600 by closing its exemption for   stand-alone bars. With a stronger statewide law that includes all workplaces, California could prevent almost 40,000 people from initiating   smoking. With the implementation of a comprehensive smoke-free law in the 27 states without one, there would be a total of 1 million   fewer adult smokers and nearly 400,000 fewer young people would become smokers. PREVENTION OF PREMATURE DEATH  Smoke-free laws also prevent the deaths of smokers by providing strong incentives for them to quit or cut down, thus reducing smokersÕ risk   of fatal disease. If every state without a comprehensive smoke-free law implemented one, more than 355,000 premature deaths among current   smokers would be prevented. The number of deaths of current smokers avoided range from several hundred in states with smaller populations   to more than 59,700 in Texas. In Pennsylvania, an estimated 11,600 deaths of current smokers would be prevented with a comprehensive   smoke-free law in place. Thirteen of the 27 states without comprehensive smoke-free laws currently in place would each prevent an estimated   10,000 premature deaths among current adult smokers. The prevented deaths will occur gradually over a long period of time after the law is   implemented and smoking declines. 5American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network Savings Lives, Saving Money: A State-By-State Report on the Health and Economic Benefits of Comprehensive Smoke-Free Laws                                                 With the implementation of a comprehensive  smoke-free law in the 27 states without one,  there would be a total of 1 million fewer adult  smokers and nearly 400,000 fewer young people would become smokers in those states.  Smoke-free laws also discourage people, particularly youth, from becoming regular smokers. Estimates  of deaths prevented by reducing the number of people who become smokers in the first place are at   least 1,000 in 23 of the 27 states without comprehensive smoke-free laws currently in effect. North   Carolina would prevent 14,600 additional smoking-related deaths among young people due to a lower   smoking initiation rate. Non-smokersÕ deaths would be prevented in every state that implements a comprehensive smoke-free  law. High-population states such as California would avoid 7,200 deaths among non-smokers. North  Carolina would avoid 5,200 deaths among non-smokers.  Saving Money Smoke-free laws provide significant economic return for states by reducing smoking and preventing   potential new smokers from starting. States with comprehensive laws are expected to spend   significantly less on treating people for tobacco-related disease and recognize major savings in programs   such as Medicaid. Reducing smoking through implementation of smoke-free laws saves states millions   of dollars in expenditures for treating lung cancer, heart attacks and strokes, pregnancy complications,   and other diseases.

Texas and California   would reduce lung cancer treatment costs by more than $33 million each.   The health care savings from reducing costs for treating heart attacks and strokes related to smoking are even greater. Thirteen states would  save at least $25 million each, with seven states saving in excess of $50 million just from lower health care costs for these two conditions.  States would also benefit from lower costs for treating smoking-related pregnancy complications. Eleven states would save at least $5 million   in five years with a comprehensive smoke-free law. Twenty out of 27 states without these laws would save at least $1 million during that   same time period.

Twelve states would save an estimated $1 million over five years by passing a comprehensive  smoke-free law. Medicaid savings alone could be a combined $42.8 million over five years in the 27 states currently without comprehensive   smoke-free laws in place.  The total estimated health care cost savings add up to hundreds of millions of dollars in some states. In 10 states, more than $50 million in  total savings on lung cancer, heart attacks and strokes, and pregnancy complications are estimated over five years. All told, the 27 states  without comprehensive laws currently in place could save an estimated $1.32 billion in health care expenditures over five years.  Policy Recommendations The number of states with smoke-free laws continues to grow, and these laws now cover the majority of the U.S. population. Still, there is   much work to be done. Many states have no statewide smoke-free law or have a law that does not cover all places or populations. Hospitality   and casino workers in many states, who are exposed to dangerous levels of secondhand smoke on the job, continue to be denied their right   to breathe smoke-free air. Opponents of smoke-free legislation continually battle to weaken existing laws through loopholes and exemptions,   further complicating efforts to achieve the benefits of these laws. States that cover only some of the population with city or county smoke-free   laws would see greater health and economic benefits if a strong, comprehensive statewide law were implemented.   As the estimates in this report show, states derive significant, measurable benefits from putting smoke-free laws in place. ACS CAN recom mends that all states aim for statewide laws that are comprehensive and protect all workers from the dangers of secondhand smoke. Weak  laws with exemptions, loopholes, or limited enforcement capacity will not achieve these results.  ¥ Smoke-free laws should cover  all workplaces. Laws should cover all workplaces, restaurants, bars, gaming facilities, hookah bars, tobacco retail stores, and cigar bars, regardless of size,  primary use, age of patrons, or number of workers.  ¥ Venues should be  100 percent smoke-free with no exceptions  such as allowing smoking in certain places or at certain times. Laws should not allow venues to use smoking rooms, ventilation, or other unproven technology to attempt to avoid compliance with smoke-  free laws. Exemptions for certain hours of the day or special events should be avoided. ¥ State smoke-free laws should  not preempt local authorities from enacting stronger local smoke-free laws.  While state laws should be comprehensive, no state law should preempt a local government from enacting a stronger law to protect people   in their workplaces and public spaces.

SMOKE-FREE SUCCESS STORY  ArizonaÕs smoke-free law enjoys broad support among both consumers and business owners. + ¥° A 2010 survey by the Arizona Department of Public Health found that over 80 percent of residents were in favor   of the smoke-free law.  ¥° Seventy-six percent believed that food and drink service establishments became healthier environments to visit as   a result of the law.  ¥° Over 70 percent of business owners were in favor of the law.  ¥° Over half of business owners felt that the smoking ban made their organizations healthier working environments.  PROTECT ARIZONAÕS STRONG LAW  Keeping all workplaces, restaurants, and bars in the state 100% smoke-free is the best way to protect all Arizona residents   from the dangers of secondhand smoke. Loopholes that allow for smoking in ventilated areas, casinos, bingo parlors,   hookah bars, or cigar bars, at certain times of day in some venues, or for certain events, weaken the law and do not  adequately protect the public. Removing any existing exemptions further strengthens the law and provides even better   protection for everyone against the dangers of secondhand smoke.  + Arizona Department of Health Services.

Smoke-free laws not only decrease exposure to tobacco   smoke and the resulting disease and death, they also decrease the number of youth who start smoking, increase the number   of smokers who quit, and cut health care costs for smokers and non-smokers alike.  New JerseyÕs smoke-free law requires all of the stateÕs workplaces, restaurants, and bars to be 100% smoke-free. New JerseyÕs  comprehensive smoke-free law went into effect on April 15, 2006.  SMOKE-FREE SUCCESS STORY  The enactment of New JerseyÕs 2006 comprehensive smoke-free law has provided public health benefits and public support   for other smoke-free venues.  ¥° Following implementation, there was 100 percent compliance with the law among restaurants, bars, and  bowling centers.+ ¥° Several months after the smoke-free law was passed, air pollution was reduced by an average of 91 percent   in these venues.+ ¥° The law has been so successful that almost 7 out of 10 New Jersey residents are supportive of extending the law   to make casinos smoke-free.* ¥° The majority of voters (74 percent) state that making casinos smoke-free would not impact how often they visit   gaming establishments, and 18 percent said they would actually go to casinos more often.*  PROTECT NEW JERSEYÕS STRONG LAW  Keeping all workplaces, restaurants, and bars in the state 100% smoke-free is the best way to protect all New Jersey   residents from the dangers of secondhand smoke. Loopholes that allow for smoking in ventilated areas, casinos, bingo   parlors, hookah bars, or cigar bars, at certain times of day in some venues, or for certain events, weaken the law and do  not adequately protect the public. Removing any existing exemptions further strengthens the law and provides even better   protection for everyone against the dangers of secondhand smoke.  +New Jersey Group Against Smoking Pollution (GASP).

Hospitality industry employment, alcohol tax revenue, and bar licenses have not been  adversely impacted by the law. ^ ¥° Following its passage, support for the smoke-free law increased. From June to September 2003, during which the law   took effect, 64 percent of New York residents said they were in favor of the smoke-free law. Just under one year after  the law had taken effect, in the second quarter of 2004, support for the law had increased to 74 percent. ^ PROTECT NEW YORKÕS STRONG LAW  Keeping all workplaces, restaurants, and bars in the state 100% smoke-free is the best way to protect all New York residents   from the dangers of secondhand smoke.

According to the Surgeon General, the science is clear: There is no safe level of exposure to second hand smoke.  Just as tobacco smoke causes lung cancer, heart attacks, strokes, and other preventable diseases in smokers,  secondhand smoke causes disease and death in non-smokers, as well. Smoke-free laws not only decrease exposure to   tobacco smoke and the resulting disease and death, they also decrease the number of youth who start smoking, increase   the number of smokers who quit, and cut health care costs for smokers and non-smokers alike.  Tennessee is one of only 15 states that currently has no law prohibiting smoking in all workplaces or restaurants or bars.  Making all workplaces, restaurants, and bars in the state 100% smoke-free is the  only way to protect all Tennessee residents  from the dangers of secondhand smoke.  SAVING LIVES  Making all Tennessee workplaces, restaurants, and bars 100% smoke-free would be expected to provide the following   reductions in the number of smokers and the number of deaths caused by smoking or exposure to tobacco smoke:*  Adults Who Would Quit Smoking  Youth Who Would  Never Start Smoking Reduction in Smoking-Related Deaths Reduction in Deaths of Non-Smokers 25,100 8,500 14,500 1,600 SAVING MONEY  In addition to saving lives, making Tennessee smoke-free would cut health care costs for both smokers and non-smokers.  Over five years, a comprehensive smoke-free law covering all Tennessee workplaces, restaurants, and bars would be   expected to produce the following economic benefits:*  Lung CancerTreatment Savings  Heart Attack and Stroke  Treatment Savings  StateÕs Medicaid  Program Savings Smoking-RelatedPregnancy Treatment Savings  $7.52M $21.18M $1.71M $3.90M *Estimates are based on analysis performed on behalf of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network.

According to the Surgeon General, the science is clear: There is no safe level of exposure to second hand smoke. Just as tobacco smoke causes lung cancer, heart attacks, strokes, and other preventable diseases in smokers,  secondhand smoke causes disease and death in non-smokers, as well. Smoke-free laws not only decrease exposure to tobacco   smoke and the resulting disease and death, they also decrease the number of youth who start smoking, increase the number   of smokers who quit, and cut health care costs for smokers and non-smokers alike.  UtahÕs smoke-free law requires all of the stateÕs workplaces, restaurants, and bars to be 100% smoke-free. UtahÕs  comprehensive smoke-free restaurants law went into effect on January 1, 1995; its comprehensive smoke-free workplaces  law went into effect on May 1, 2006; and its comprehensive smoke-free bars law went into effect on January 1, 2009.  SMOKE-FREE SUCCESS STORY  The implementation of UtahÕs statewide smoke-free law has contributed to positive public health and economic outcomes.  ¥° The rate of adult smoking decreased from 14 percent in 1999 to 9.8 percent in 2009. + ¥° Research comparing hotel revenues and tourism rates before and after the smoke-free restaurant law showed that  the law did not negatively affect business. In fact, it may be associated with an increase in tourism.*  PROTECT UTAHÕS STRONG LAW  Keeping all workplaces, restaurants, and bars in the state 100% smoke-free is the best way to protect all Utah residents   from the dangers of secondhand smoke. Loopholes that allow for smoking in ventilated areas, casinos, bingo parlors,   hookah bars, or cigar bars, at certain times of day in some venues, or for certain events, weaken the law and do not  adequately protect the public. Removing any existing exemptions further strengthens the law and provides even better   protection for everyone against the dangers of secondhand smoke.  + Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

VermontÕs  comprehensive smoke-free restaurants and bars law went into effect on September 1, 2005, and its comprehensive smoke- free workplaces law went into effect on July 1, 2009.  SMOKE-FREE SUCCESS STORY  Since VermontÕs smoke-free laws have taken effect, the state has seen reductions in smoking and increases in quit attempts.   ¥° The adult smoking rate in Vermont declined 24 percent between 2001 and 2009, four years after the stateÕs  comprehensive restaurant and bar smoke-free law took effect, compared with only a 10 percent decline nationwide  during that time period.+ ¥° The percentage of smokers who tried to quit increased from 50.1 percent in 2004 to 62.2 percent in 2008.  + ¥° Each year, Vermont spends more than $430 million in smoking-related health care costs and lost productivity.*   VermontÕs smoke-free law and other tobacco control measures will help to reduce these smoking-related costs.

SMOKE-FREE SUCCESS STORY  WashingtonÕs comprehensive smoke-free law has contributed to public health and economic benefits.  ¥° One year after the implementation of the comprehensive statewide smoke-free law in Washington, the adult smoking  rate dropped to 17.8 percent, the 5 th lowest in the country at the time.+ ¥° Exposure to secondhand smoke among restaurant and bar employees dropped from 29 percent in 2005 to about   3 percent in 2006.* The smoke-free law also prompted many smokers to try to quit. According to the Washington  State Department of Health, the stateÕs Tobacco Quit Line reported receiving a record number of calls in the month   after implementation.* ¥° According to a 2011 Washington State Department of Health report, each dollar spent on tobacco prevention   in the last 10 years resulted in five dollars in reduced hospitalization costs. ^ PROTECT WASHINGTONÕS STRONG LAW  Keeping all workplaces, restaurants, and bars in the state 100% smoke-free is the best way to protect all Washington   residents from the dangers of secondhand smoke.

A smoke-free policy  adopted by a public housing authority or an owner of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)-assisted housing may apply to smokers who already live in the building in addition to new residents as long as they are given ﬁlegally adequateﬂ notice.HUD has strongly encouraged public housing authorities to adopt smoke-free policies to protect the health of residents, who are often more vulnerable to secondhand smoke than those of higher income.Smoking is not a disability under federal or state law. In fact, prohibiting smoking can protect  against lawsuits by tenants with certain disabilities that are exacerbated by exposure to secondhand smoke.  Public housing authorities may change their house rules or leases to make individual units smoke-free. Those authorities that prefer to incorporate a  smoke-free policy into a lease may want to consult a change is considered ﬁreasonable.ﬂ Project-based section 8 housing may adopt a smoke-free policy by changing their house rules; owners must receive approval from HUD to change their leases. In the past, HUD has denied requests to change a lease to incorporate a smoke-free policy, but HUD™s views  may be changing. Providers of voucher-based  housing may choose to adopt a smoke-free policy through a rules change or by changing the lease, as long as all tenants are treated equally. ŁŁŁŁIntroduction In recent years, the smoke-free  trend has swept into multi-unit  housing as landlords, condominium  owners and housing authorities  have discovered the health and  financial benefits of smoke-free  multi-unit housing. Public housing  authorities and owners of multi-unit  subsidized housing have been on the  leading edge of this trend. In 2008,  the National Multi-Unit Housing  Council (NMHC), which represents   States, stated that the smoke-free  trend ﬁis actually more common  in public housing than privately  owned housing at this point.ﬂ 1 As an  example, at the beginning of January  2005, seventeen housing authorities  in six states had smoke-free policies  for some or all of their buildings.  By February 2010, this number  had soared to 141 local housing  authorities in twenty states.2The rising popularity of smoke- free policies for subsidized or  affordable housing units has led to  the need for research into the legal  and procedural aspects of adopting  and implementing such policies.  ﬁSubsidizedﬂ and ﬁaffordableﬂ are  terms that generally refer to housing  that receives government funding to  assist those with lower incomes who  are unable to pay the property™s full  rent. Different programs establish  different income levels to qualify  2for a government housing subsidy. In addition to  income-based requirements, some government  programs target certain segments of the population.  For example, Section 202 is a U.S. Department of  Housing and Urban Development (HUD)-assisted  housing program for low-income seniors and  Section 811 is HUD-assisted housing for those  who have a disability and are low income.While many government programs provide  affordable housing, this synopsis is limited to the  three most common forms of such housing, which  are: (1) public housing developments; (2) project- based section 8 housing; and (3) voucher-based  section 8 housing. Public housing developments  are owned and managed by local city or county  housing authorities. If the local housing authority  receives federal subsidies, then it must follow  certain regulations of HUD. Under the section 8  project-based housing program, a private multi- unit housing development receives federal HUD  funding to defray a portion of tenants™ rent and  the subsidy remains with the property. Under the  section 8 voucher program, HUD provides the  eligible tenant with a voucher to offset rent at  a private multi-unit development. Because the  subsidy stays with the tenant, not the property,  the tenant may use the voucher at a different  location. Much of the information in this synopsis  may apply to other kinds of affordable housing,  but procedures for enacting and implementing a  smoke-free policy may differ. Section I documents the urgent need for smoke- free housing for those who have lower incomes,   smoke-free housing. Section II makes it clear that  it is legal to prohibit smoking in public housing  and HUD-assisted residential units, debunks the  mistaken belief that smoking is a disability and  discusses why allowing smoking could lead to  lawsuits against the housing authority. Finally,  Section III outlines the procedure that public  housing authorities and HUD-assisted owners  must follow to enact smoke-free policies legally  and provides recommendations on how to enforce  such policies.Section I Œ The Case for Affordable Smoke-Free Housing The movement toward smoke-free affordable  housing is accelerating in the wake of a HUD  notice (ﬁHUD Noticeﬂ), issued on July 17, 2009,  strongly encouraging public housing authorities  to adopt smoke-free policies in their multi-unit  housing units. 3 of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control  released a strategic plan targeting, among other  measures, the elimination of secondhand smoke in  homes ﬁto protect the health of children and other  sensitive populations in low-income households.ﬂ 4 Concurrently with the release of the Healthy  Homes Strategic Plan, the U.S. Surgeon General  had released ﬁThe Surgeon General™s Call to  Action to Promote Healthy Homes,ﬂ which called  for the elimination of secondhand smoke to protect  residents from health hazards in the home. 5 This   in 2006, that ﬁthere is no risk-free level of exposure  to secondhand smokeﬂ and that ﬁ[s]eparating  smokers from nonsmokers, cleaning the air, and  ventilating buildings cannot eliminate exposures  of nonsmokers to second-hand smoke.ﬂ 6 The  report also concluded that exposure to secondhand  smoke raises the risk of heart disease by at least  one quarter (25 to 30 percent).7Residents of Affordable Housing are  Especially Vulnerable to Secondhand SmokeAccording to the HUD Notice, more than half of  public housing residents (54 percent) are either  children or elderly residents over age sixty-two. 8 These populations ﬁare especially vulnerable to  the effects of [secondhand smoke].ﬂ 9 For children,  secondhand smoke increases the likelihood that  they will develop bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma,  poorer lung function and other breathing problems,  as well as ear infections. 10 For the elderly, every  major cause of death in their population Œ cancer,  heart disease, and stroke Œ is associated with  smoking and secondhand smoke, thus causing  3them ﬁin particular [to] bear a disproportionate  burden of the negative effects of smoking and  secondhand smoke.ﬂ11  The HUD Notice also mentioned that in addition to  the young and the elderly, there are ﬁa considerable  number of [public housing] residents with chronic  diseases such as asthma and cardiovascular  disease who are particularly vulnerable to the  effects of [secondhand smoke].ﬂ 12  A 2009  research study noted as well that low-income and  underserved racial and ethnic minorities, who live  disproportionately in public or subsidized housing,  suffer more from ﬁtobacco-related morbidity and  mortality, [and] have an increased incidence of  heart disease as well as asthma and cancer.ﬂ 13  Additionally, according to data from Boston™s 2005  Respiratory Health of Public Housing Residents  survey, a disproportionate number of smokers  live in public versus private housing, as well as  a higher percentage of adults with asthma. 14 The  special vulnerability of a substantial number of  residents of low income housing makes the case  for smoke-free housing even more compelling.The Market for Smoke-Free Affordable  HousingA majority of low income individuals do not  smoke, creating a demand for smoke-free units that  the market currently is not meeting. Nearly three  quarters (72 percent) of Americans with incomes  under $20,000 a year are non-smokers. 15  Smoking  rates are low in those groups disproportionately  represented in low-income housing: more than 90   smoke; more than 75 percent of African Americans  do not smoke; and 85 percent of Hispanics are  non-smokers.16  A 2009 survey of tenants in the four-county  Portland, Oregon metropolitan area revealed  that non-smoking tenants greatly outnumbered  smoking tenants, and nearly half (46 percent) of all  tenants were not comfortable renting an apartment  adjacent to smokers. According to the study, ﬁthe  number of applicants who will avoid smoking- permitted units is almost  4 times greater than the number of applicants who will avoid no-smoking  units.ﬂ17 The study concluded: As to the enduring perception that lower  income renters are substantially different  from higher income renters on this type of   have seen in past research as well: It simply  is not true. While it is true that lower income  renters are somewhat more likely to be  smokers themselves, this does not translate  into a greater tolerance to live next door to  indoor smokers.18 In keeping with this, a recent survey of residents of  public housing in Boston found that nearly half (49  percent) of tenants were experiencing secondhand  smoke incursion and nearly three quarters of all  tenants agreed that exposure to secondhand smoke  is harmful.19Secondhand Smoke Transfer in  Affordable Housing A recent Harvard School of Public Health study  suggested that greater exposure to secondhand  smoke in low-income housing is likely due to higher  smoking rates, smaller units, poor venti-lation, and   20  The Harvard study,  which examined forty-nine low-income multi-unit  residences, detected nicotine in 89 percent of non- smoking homes studied.  21 4The study concluded that secondhand smoke ﬁmay  infiltrate into homes through windows, doors,  shared air spaces, holes, and ventilation systems if  cigarettes are smoked outside or in neighbouring  residences.ﬂ  22  Research demonstrates that up to 65  percent of air can be exchanged between units.23 The recent HUD Notice cited the problem of  secondhand smoke seepage as a reason to adopt  a smoke-free policy in public housing. According  to the Notice, ﬁ[b]ecause [secondhand smoke] can  migrate between units in multifamily housing,  causing respiratory illness, heart disease, cancer,  and other adverse health effects in neighboring  families, the Department is encouraging PHAs  to adopt non-smoking policies.ﬂ 24  Further, the  Notice stated that its issuance ﬁwill enhance  the effectiveness of [HUD™s] efforts to provide  increased public health protection for residents  of public housing.25The 2006 Surgeon General™s report discussed the   housing and supported the adoption of smoke-free  policies. 26  The report warned against reliance on air   involuntary smoke exposure. 27  may reduce smoke odor, they are not designed to  remove the toxic particles from tobacco smoke. 28 The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration  and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE),  which sets the standard for indoor air quality, has   is capable of eliminating secondhand smoke.  Consequently, ASHRAE does not recommend  a ventilation standard for buildings that permit  smoking. According to ASHRAE, ﬁ[a]t present, the  only means of effectively eliminating [the] health  risk associated with indoor exposure is to ban  smoking activity.ﬂ 29  Adjusting ventilation, sealing  gaps, and other remedial treatments may reduce  but not eliminate secondhand smoke exposure.30 As public awareness of the health risks of  secondhand smoke increases, owners and managers  who continue to allow smoking can expect to  spend more time refereeing disputes and engaging  in remediation efforts. ﬁProperty managers say  complaints about secondhand smoke in apartment  communities are on the rise,ﬂ according to the  National Multi-Unit Housing Council (NMHC).  The Council notes, ﬁA majority of renters would  actually prefer to rent an apartment in a smoke-free  community. In addition, about half say that they  have moved or would move because of secondhand  smoke.ﬂ 31  The National Center for Healthy Housing  has reported that secondhand smoke complaints  and requests for unit transfers drop following the  implementation of a smoke-free policy. 32Smoke-Free Policies Save Money  While adopting smoke-free policies is good public   is particularly critical in an economic downturn.  Preventing fires from cigarettes is yet another  good example of a public health measure that  saves money. Cigarette smoking is a leading cause   smoking kill more people than any other kind   Administration (USFA), smoking was responsible    which statistics are available. 33  The USFA reports  that older residents are at especially high risk for  34The National Multi-Unit Housing Council notes  that restricting smoking in apartment units can  help owners reduce the ﬁextremely costly risk of     reduce property insurance premiums, although  no statistics are readily available to indicate what   bans enjoy.ﬂ 35 Landlords and public housing authorities who go  smoke-free can also save money on cleaning costs  and building maintenance, stretching building  budgets. For example, data collected in 2009  from housing authorities and subsidized housing  facilities in New England indicated that the cost  5of rehabilitating a unit was more than double for  a light smoker ($1,810) vs. a non-smoker ($560).  Even more dramatic, the cost of rehabilitating the   nearly $3,000 more, than the cost of rehabilitating a  non-smoker™s unit. 36   According to NMHC, ﬁSome  estimates suggest that cleaning walls, carpets,   $400 to $3,000 to unit turnover costs, depending on  the length of residency and how much the resident  smoked in the unit.ﬂ37 In addition, banning smoking reduces the load on  heating and air-conditioning equipment, lowering  operating costs. According to an article in the  Occupational Health and Safety Journal, ﬁ[t]he  option of banning smoking from facilities brings the   less maintenance on air handling equipment, and  lower operating costs for the HVAC system.ﬂ 38  HUD, in its 2009 notice, recommended a non- smoking policy as a lower-cost means of achieving  good indoor air quality (IAQ). According to  the HUD Notice, achieving good IAQ requires  minimizing indoor air pollutants. Because ﬁETS  [environmental tobacco smoke] is known to be an   PHA [public housing authority] to achieve good  IAQ [indoor air quality] in its buildings if residents  are allowed to smoke, especially indoors.ﬂ The  notice further stated that a non-smoking policy  was an ﬁexcellent approachﬂ for those PHAs  seeking to improve their IAQ without the costs  of renovation.39Other possible savings from smoke-free policies  are:Ł    In several states (such as Maine, California  and New Hampshire), developers of low- income housing are able to earn tax credits  for providing smoke-free housing.40Ł   Smoke-free policies can help a building  earn ﬁGreen Buildingﬂ program credits  through programs such as the U.S. Green  Building Council™s Leadership in Energy  and Environmental Design (LEED)  program.41 Section II Œ Prohibiting Smoking  in Public Housing and HUD-Assisted Housing UnitsHUD Encourages the Adoption of Smoke-Free Policies HUD has indicated that subsidized and public  housing providers are free under federal law to  prohibit smoking in residential units as long as  the policies comply with applicable state and local  laws.42 There are no federal or state laws or cases  that prohibit HUD-assisted property owners and  PHAs from offering smoke-free rentals 43  and there  are no constitutional protections for smokers.44 The Chief Counsel in HUD™s Detroit office  concluded in a 2003 letter that private owners  of HUD-assisted housing may prohibit smoking  as long as they are in compliance with any state  law on smoking. The letter stated that ﬁthe right  to smoke or not to smoke is not a right that is  protected under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or  any other HUD-enforced civil rights authori-ties. .  . .ﬂ 45  In August 2007, the Chief Counsel of HUD™s   that with respect to multi-residential properties  assisted by HUD ﬁthere is no HUD policy, by  statute, regulation, handbook or otherwise that  restricts landlords from adopting a prohibition  of smoking in common areas or in individual  units.ﬂ46 A similar letter, written in January 2007 by the   noted that in Michigan ﬁseveral housing authorities  and private landlords and management companies  have voluntarily adopted smoke-free policies for  their HUD-assisted developments.ﬂ The letter   restricting smoking in HUD-assisted housing.47 A 1996 HUD opinion permitted Nebraska™s  Kearney Housing Authority to ban smoking  in its public housing development. That same  year, a HUD opinion permitted the Fort Pierce  6Housing Authority in Florida to ban smoking in  its public housing. 48  HUD has also agreed to a  non-smoking policy in two cases brought under  the Fair Housing Act. In 1998, HUD approved  a conciliation agreement providing smoke-free  housing in a private HUD-assisted building for  a tenant with respiratory difficulties who was  exposed to smoke from a neighboring apartment. 49  In 2002, the Seattle Housing Authority entered into  a consent decree providing a smoke-free unit for  a tenant who had a respiratory condition after the  Department of Justice brought suit. In response  to the lawsuit, the housing authority made one  building at a high-rise complex smoke-free and  phased in a non-smoking policy in the other two  buildings at the complex. 50  Most recently, in its  2009 Notice, HUD has made it clear that it not  only permits smoke-free policies but now actively  encourages public housing authorities to adopt  them.51 Smoking is Not a Disability under  Federal or State LawsConstitutional LawThe National Multi-Unit Housing Council has  noted that ﬁone of the biggest reasons many  apartment firms have been hesitant to adopt  smoke-free policies is a mistaken belief that  restricting a resident™s ability to smoke on the  property or within [his or her] apartment could  violate the law.ﬂ However, the council noted in  its attorney-written memorandum, ﬁThere is no  ‚right to smoke™ and smokers are not a protected   actually reduce their legal liability by restricting  or banning smoking.ﬂ52State and federal courts have consistently ruled  that smoking is not a protected activity under  the U.S. Constitution or state constitutions, and  smokers are not a protected class. 53 The court in  Axelrod v. Fagan  stated bluntly, ﬁ[t]here is no more  a fundamental right to smoke cigarettes than there  is to shoot up or snort heroin or cocaine or run a  red light.ﬂ54Statutory LawSeveral pieces of federal legislation protect the  rights of the disabled. The federal Fair Housing  Act (FHA) prohibits housing discrimination based  on disability (in addition to race, color, religion,  sex, family status and national origin). 55   Other  anti-discrimination laws, including Section 504  of the Rehabilitation Act 56  and Title II of the  Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 57  as well  as various state laws, prohibit discrimination based  on disability. However, none of these laws protect smokers. For  example, in  Brashear v. Simms , a federal court  dismissed as ﬁfrivolousﬂ a state prisoner™s claim  that a smoking ban in Maryland™s prisons violated  his rights as a smoker under the ADA. The court  stated:[C]ommon sense compels the conclusion  that smoking . . . is not a ﬁdisabilityﬂ  within the meaning of the ADA. Congress  could not possibly have intended the  absurd result of including smoking within   render somewhere between 25 percent  and 30 percent of the American public  disabled under federal law because they  smoke.58A state court expressed this same concern in a  ruling against a smoker who alleged a violation of  state disability laws as well as the ADA. The Court  of Appeals of Michigan ruled that an employee who   not protected under the state™s civil rights act or  the ADA. 59  The court said that classifying smoking  as a disability would thwart the purposes of the  state™s Handicappers™ Civil Rights Act (HCRA).  ﬁPlaintiff™s claimed ‚handicap™ is shared by  countless other individuals in the workplace and in  society as a whole,ﬂ the court stated. 60  It concluded  that to ﬁautomatically label this condition as one  that substantially impairs a major life activity is  inconsistent with the HCRA and would do a gross  disservice to the truly handicapped.ﬂ617While that case™s holding applies only to Michigan  disability laws, no court has found that state  disability laws protect smokers. A law review  article examining the issue of secondhand smoke  in multi-unit residential housing noted that while  smoking behavior can change frequently, state  anti-discrimination laws were intended to protect  only immutable characteristics. According to the  author, ﬁthe reality is that more than 30 million  Americans have quit and thousands more start  smoking every day.ﬂ 62Liability for Failure to Provide Smoke- Free Housing While smokers cannot avail themselves of any legal  protection under federal and state disability laws  because smoking is not considered a disability,  non-smokers exposed to smoke in multi-unit  housing can access those same laws under certain  limited circumstances. The National Multi-Unit  Housing Council has warned its members that  ﬁcourts have held that an apartment resident with   secondhand smoke may actually be entitled to a  reasonable accommodation under the Fair Housing  Act.ﬂ It went on to note:In contrast to conventional wisdom,  apartment owners may be held more  legally liable by allowing smoking than by  restricting it. Residents have become more  knowledgeable about the risks of secondhand  smoke and savvier about pursuing legal  options to protect their health. State courts  have ruled against apartment owners and   other penalties under the nuisance, warranty  of habitability, and quiet enjoyment theories  of law. 63 However, simply showing an adverse health   proof of a ﬁdisabilityﬂ under the Fair Housing Act  (FHA). To use the FHA, the affected person must  prove the adverse health reaction substantially  limits one or more major life activities 64 Œ which  could include things such as breathing, walking  or performing manual tasks.  A person who merely   obtain FHA protection. 65  Some state disability laws   standards under various state laws for showing a  disability affected by secondhand smoke exposure  appear equally high.66 If a non-smoker has a medical condition severe  enough to be considered a disability under state  or federal law, then he or she is entitled to a  ﬁreasonable accommodationﬂ to protect against  secondhand smoke as long as the accommodation  does not impose an ﬁundue hardshipﬂ on the  housing provider. 67  Such an accommodation  could include developing or enforcing a smoke- free policy, either in the building or in the units  surrounding the affected non-smoker, repairs to   to a unit away from the secondhand smoke. The  non-smoker may seek to have smoking banned  from building common areas if secondhand smoke  is seeping into his or her unit from those areas. 68 Which actions are considered a ﬁreasonable  accommodationﬂ and which might be considered  an ﬁundue hardshipﬂ (and thus not required) are  determined on a case-by-case basis. Section III Œ Adopting a Smoke-Free Policy for Affordable  Housing The decision to adopt a smoke-free policy for  affordable housing does not end the process.  Public housing authorities and each type of HUD- assisted housing have different requirements for  giving notice to tenants of the change and there  are different rules on whether the change needs  to be made through the lease or through a change  in tenant rules. As the chief counsel of the HUD  HUD . . . funds a substantial variety of  housing programs . . . each with its own  set of rules as to residency and occupancy.  None, however, prohibit establishment of a  8smoke-free environment. The differences  might be as to whether the establishment can  be through the lease, a lease addendum, or  a house rule. Section 202/811 projects, for   model lease, but a smoke-free policy could  be established through the house rules.69Public Housing Authority (PHA)A public housing authority can adopt a smoke- free policy through house rules 70  or through a  change in the lease. House rules must be posted  in a conspicuous manner and incorporated by  reference in the lease. 71  Before making a rule  change, public housing authorities must provide  residents with a 30-day notice and the opportunity  to present written comments.72A public housing authority can implement a policy  change through a lease addendum if the provision  is considered ﬁreasonable.ﬂ 73  While in the past   HUD™s PHA regulations have said that HUD would  be unlikely to support a smoke-free amendment  to a lease, 74 the 2009 HUD notice states: ﬁPHAs  are encouraged to revise their lease agreements to  include the non-smoking provisions.ﬂ 75  The HUD  notice is a ﬁrecommendationﬂ to local housing  authorities, and not a directive, so if the PHA  would prefer to make the change in its house rules,  it is permissible.  The advantage of having a smoke-free provision  in the lease rather than a house rule is that,  if challenged by a non-compliant tenant, the  provision is more likely to withstand judicial  scrutiny. A lease provision provides a tenant with  clear and conspicuous notice of any smoking ban.  Before adopting a lease change, which is effective  only at the end of a lease term, the public housing  authority needs to give tenants at least sixty days  of notice prior to the end of the term. 76  Due to the  advantages of a smoke-free lease provision versus  a rule change, advocates may decide to move  forward with a lease addendum or may want to  ask for an opinion on a lease addendum from their  A smoke-free lease provision is clearly permissible  for the twenty-nine housing authorities participating  in a HUD pilot project for low-income housing. 77 Congress in 1996 created the ﬁMoving to Workﬂ  program to allow a limited number of public  housing authorities to design and test innovative  local housing strategies for low-income families.  Housing authorities under the Moving to Work  program are exempt from existing HUD public  housing regulations, and consequently have  the discretion to add a smoke-free provision to  their leases. 78  Since 2001, the Seattle housing  authority has offered a smoke-free lease at its  Tri-Court public housing development under this  program.79Project-Based Section 8 Housing In general, private multi-unit housing projects  that accept federal subsidies tied to the property  (i.e., project-based Section 8 housing) must use  a HUD-approved lease 80 and must receive HUD  approval to make any changes in the lease. 81  HUD may approve changes to keep the lease in  compliance with state or local law or to conform  to ﬁproperty management practices generally used  in the project™s market area.ﬂ 82 Although not a HUD requirement, 83 a 2003 letter   office makes it clear that project owners may  adopt non-smoking policies through a change  in the house rules. The letter states: ﬁ[P]roject  owners may devise reasonable no smoking rules  at their properties that express legitimate concerns  for the safety of the residents and condition of  individual units and buildings as a whole. As long  as no-smoking policies meet the normal house  rules criteria, HUD approval is not required.ﬂ  The letter goes on to note that if owners want to  make the non-smoking policy a condition of the  lease, ﬁHUD approval is required to the extent  that the owner is bound to utilize HUD™s model  lease.ﬂ84  The language in the 2009 HUD Notice  recommending that public housing authorities  make the change in their lease provisions, bodes  well for project owners seeking HUD approval for  such lease changes.9Voucher-Based Section 8 Housing Private developments that accept vouchers can  adopt a smoke-free policy either through a lease  addendum or through house rules. However, if the  change is made through a change to the owner™s  standard lease form, it must apply to all residents  and not just to federally assisted tenants. 85 There  are no particular notice procedures required under  the voucher program other than the state and local  notice requirements that apply to all landlords.Grandfathering of Existing Tenants  The 2009 HUD notice stated that public housing  authorities have exercised considerable discretion in  implementing their smoke-free policies. According  to the notice, ﬁ[s]ome PHAs have established  smoke-free buildings. Some PHAs have continued  to allow current residents who smoke to continue  to do so, but only in designated areas and only  until lease renewal or a date established by the  PHA. Some PHAs are prohibiting smoking for  new residents.ﬂ86 It is apparent from this notice, and other HUD  letters, that it is permissible to enact a smoke-free  policy that applies both to current as well as new  residents of a PHA or HUD assisted-housing,  including current smokers. PHAs and HUD- assisted housing providers are not required to  permanently ﬁgrandfatherﬂ or exempt existing  tenants, although they must provide ﬁlegally  adequateﬂ notice of any impending change. For  example, the recent letter from the Chief Counsel   was no HUD policy requiring HUD-assisted  properties to grandfather existing tenants, but that  state and local law must be followed, which would  include any notice provisions.87 A 2004 letter from the regional director of the   by HUD legal staff, noted that HUD did not require  the permanent grandfathering of any tenant in  HUD-assisted housing. The letter stated that it  is permissible to require existing tenants to stop  smoking in their units as long as they are given  88 in her 2003 letter stated that owners of HUD- assisted housing must ﬁtake caution to grandfather  in those smoking residents currently residing at  the complex.ﬂ 89  ﬁgrandfatherﬂ as used in her letter does not mean  a permanent exemption for existing smokers. She  said that the landlord could either wait until the  annual review or expiration of the smoker™s lease,  or, in the case of a long-term lease, until after the  provision of legally adequate notice. She said that  it was reasonable to require tenants with long-term  leases to move or cease smoking, as long as the  smoker received reasonably adequate advance  notice.90 It should be noted that leases in a public housing  project technically do not ﬁexpireﬂ under HUD  regulations. All public housing leases are for  one-year terms, and are renewable annually ﬁin  perpetuityﬂ as long as the tenant is in compliance  with certain key lease provisions. Although  10the leases are renewable annually, they may be  91Implementing a smoke-free policy after the lease™s  expiration or after providing legally adequate  notice makes sense due to the length of time it  would take for a building to become completely  smoke-free if the owner had to wait for each tenant  to move or die. Waiting for such a prolonged period  defeats the purpose of a smoke-free policy, as  individual units are not truly smoke-free until the  entire building is smoke-free. Residents who suffer  from exposure to secondhand smoke should not  have to wait for every smoking tenant to leave or  die in order to get relief from their symptoms. From a practical standpoint, it is easier to make the  change to smoke-free at the time of lease review  or renewal or after providing legally adequate  notice because it reduces the amount of time that  differing rules will apply to tenants. For example,  in the case discussed in Section II involving a  HUD-approved conciliation agreement providing  smoke-free housing for a tenant with respiratory   smoke in their apartments for as long as they  stayed in the apartment building. 92  According to the  building™s manager, this approach has caused some   some new tenants were confused as to why they  were required to comply with the smoke-free policy  when existing tenants were permitted to smoke. In  a few instances management or tenants believed  that a new tenant was smoking in violation of the  ban but were unable to prove it. Overall, however,  the manager reported that tenant response to the  new smoke-free policy is positive.93ConclusionWe owe our elderly, our children, and those with  chronic illness a safe shelter that does not include  secondhand tobacco smoke. When we adopt a  smoke-free policy, we have a rare opportunity to do  what is right while saving money and preventing  lawsuits. It is not only legal to prohibit smoking  in public and HUD-assisted housing, but it also  protects against lawsuits from tenants exposed to  secondhand smoke. The change to smoke-free status in multi-unit  affordable housing can take place at the time of  lease renewal or after legally adequate notice.  Public housing directors from the twenty-nine  Moving to Work program sites are urged to make  the change as part of the public housing lease  rather than through house rules. Housing directors  and project-based Section 8 housing providers  can adopt the change through house rules and  possibly through a change in the lease. Providers  of voucherŒbased Section 8 housing can either  make a rules change or change the lease, as long as  subsidized and non-subsidized tenants are treated  equally.   Affordable housing providers are urged to join the  growing smoke-free movement within the multi- unit housing market. Smoke-free housing should not be a right reserved only for the rich.

Preemption   occurs when  a ﬁhigher ﬂ level of government  eliminates or limits the  authority of  a ﬁlower ﬂ level of government to regulate a certain issue .  When laws are preempted, they have no force or effect.  Because local   control is so integral to tobacco control, the tobacco industry and  its   allies have historically used, and continue to use, preemptive strategies   to thwart smoke -free laws, youth access  and retailer licensing  restrictions, advertising  and  promotion  regulations, and similar policies.       For decades,  the strongest and most  innovative tobacco control policies have  emerged  at the  local level  Œ often  after  long and hard -fought  grassroots community efforts  Œ before ultimately  being adopted at the state  or federal  level. These grassroots campaigns increase local awareness  of tobacco control issues,  build community readiness and support, and  foster  public  debate  about  the need for policy change and healthy social norms. A preemptive  state or federal  law can   invalida te many local tobacco control policies that represent years of efforts at the local level.   Moreover, o nce enacted, preemptive laws are traditionally difficult to repeal , and can affect not  just the legal but also the advocacy landscape for years to come . Unfortunately, but not  surprisingly, research has shown that preemption has  result ed in health and social norm  disparities between states where local authorities have the ability to adopt tobacco control   policies  and states where local authorities are pree mpted from enacting  such policies.      The tobacco industry  has been  relentless  in its  pursuit of  preemption to  weaken , impede  or  defeat  tobacco control efforts.  Preemptive policies and legal challenges  can  often  block  state and  local  advances in  tobacco  control , and  seemingly innocuous  preemptive language in serted  into  proposed  legislation can  derail important  tobacco control initiatives .  For more information , see  the Consortium™s  Preemption: The Biggest Challenge to Tobacco Control . This publication  describes  common ways preemption can affect tobacco control strategies , and  provides examples  of preemptive and non -preemptive legislative language , guidelines on preventing or addressing  preemption in tobacco control legislation , select  tobacco -related legal challenges to preemption,  and  a list of resources on preemption and tobacco control.

RE:  FR 5597 - P - 02 Institu ting Smoke - Free Public Housing     Dear  Se cretary Castro ,      The Conference of Boston Teaching Hospitals (COBTH) on behalf of its fourteen member institutions is  pleased to offer the following comments in strong support of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD) proposed rule   to make all indoor pu blic housing in the U.S. smoke - free,  as well as  designating the surrounding    around public housing  as a smoke - free  barrier.   Additionally COBTH  would suggest two additions to the proposed rule to strengthen its effectiveness namely: (1) that the  smoke - fr ee provisions include electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and hookah pipes and  devices; and  ( 2) that the rule applies to all multi - unit housing properties that accepts funding from HUD .         Annually more than 8,000 Massachusetts residents die from  tobacco related causes which include  cancer, heart disease, stroke, emphysema, and other respiratory diseases. 1   This estimate includes  nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke whose risk for heart disease is increased by 25 - 30% and risk  for lung cancer is in crease d   by 20 - 30% as a result of their exposure.      In a report  2   published by t he Massachusetts   Department of Public   Health   (DPH) with data from 2014,  population  groups  that more frequently  occupy public housing      namely  individuals of low socio - economic s tatus and people with disabilities      were found to be   more likely to smoke and be exposed to  secondhand   smoke.  DPH estimated that   14.7% of Massachusetts adu lts (or 763,960 residents) were, in  2014,  smokers   and  that individuals of low socio - economic status  and people with disabilities,  were  among those   groups whose smoking rate was highest.   Specifically   it found that   32.8% of people on  MassHealth (    program ),   26.3% of individuals  with   a disability, and 26.3% of  households  whose income  was   less than $25k, were more likely to smoke.      workplaces, restaurants, and bars which effectively reduced the overall exposure of nonsmoking adults  to secondhand  smoke from 32% in 2002 to 10% in 2014. However, the risk of secondhand smoke in the  home, particularly for those who live in multi - unit dwellings like public housing, continues to be a risk  for nonsmokers.                                                         1   http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/tobacco - control/adults - health - consequences.pdf   2   http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/tobacco - control/adults - who - smoke.pdf   11 Beacon Street, Suite 710   Boston, MA  02108   Phone:  617 - 723 - 6100   Fax:  617 - 723 - 6111   www.cobth.org      Faulkner Hospital     -          In  a second   report , 3   DPH estimated  that  16.4% of  Massachusetts households allow ed   smoking in their  homes   thereby exposing a potential   456,000 adult  nonsmokers   to  secondhand   smoke for   more than one  hour per week.  Specifically   the report found,   19.5% of people on MassHealth, 13.6% of people with  disabiliti es, and 17.2% of households whose income was less than $25k, were more likely to be exposed  to  secondhand   smoke.       According to 2013 data, 4   13% of Massachusetts households with children allow smoking in the home.  This means that an estimated 187,000 childr en in the Commonwealth  are exposed to   the dangerous  conditions     sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), acute respiratory infections, ear problems, and more  frequent and severe asthma attacks     a ssociated with secondhand smoke .     Following passage of the 2004   smoke - free workplace legislation, the Commonwealth had 577 fewer  heart attack deaths annually than expected. 5    Additionally it was found that overall indoor air quality  improved throughout the state.   Including both suggested additions with the proposed ru le would  further improve the outcome of the measure as well as the quality of air in the home.      Inclusion of      to the proposed rule , that smoke - free provisions include electronic  nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and hookah pipes and   devices,   would ensure that nonsmokers and  children experience the same level of indoor air quality in their home as they may find in public spaces.  The emissions from ENDS aerosol are    .  R ather , the emissions from ENDS devices  conta in nicotine  and   additional toxins   whose level is not   regulated nor subject to manufacturer  standards . While  ENDS emissions contain  fewer  toxins  than the 250 chemicals contained in secondhand  smoke, the vapor released by ENDS devices contain  acetaldehydes ,  a known cancer causing substance.  The smoke from Hookah devices contain  high levels of nicotine, carbon monoxide, carcinogens,  hydrocarbons, heavy metals ,   and fine particles, which are  higher levels than cigarettes.  The risks of  hookah are documented to be   similar  to the  risks  of   cigarette   smoking, including lung cancer, respiratory  illness, low birth weight, and   respiratory problems among infants . It is in the best interest of those who     proposed smoke - free rule.      housing properties that accept funding from HUD so that more individuals are protected from the  potential risks and dangers asso ciated with exposure to tobacco smoke and ENDS emissions.     COBTH and its members believe  the proposed rule to  be a valid and necessary public health endeavor.  We therefore respectfully request the proposed rule be a dopted as amended.

The Westlawn Partnership for a Healthier Environment  is a group of community stakeholders  that   has met on a regular basis since 2008 to identify, prioritize, and address environmental  health concerns in the Westlawn community.  Located in northwest Milwaukee, Westlawn is   - subsidized housing development.     Milwauke e County ranks as the worst county in the State of Wisconsin for asthma - related  hospitalizations and emergency department visits.  Moreover, specific to  the  Westlawn   community , the rate of hospitalizations for asthma among children is nearly twice that of  Mi l w aukee County, and the rate of asthma - related emergency department visits is 1.5 times  higher in this community compared to the rest of the county.  Thus, smoke - free housing could  help to   reduce asthma triggers, improve indoor air quality ,   and   improve health outcomes   for  children and families in Westlawn and beyond.       Thank  you for proposing this important rule     it  has the potential to reduce health care costs,  save lives, and improve the quality of life for so many Americans.

      "As I so understand the healthy thinking, the second hand smoke thing and I can see the reasoning for the cost of maintenance.  I think it's fair to ban smoking inside public housing.  But, I feel it is a violation of taking away one's freedom to choose.  Even God gave us the right to make our own decisions.  Your right, it's probably healthier for all, I know it is for me, I've been smoking for 40 years and I should quit smoking, I want to quit smoking as I wouldn't be able to walk 25 feet to smoke especially in the winter.  But it's my right to make my own decisions, couldn't a compromise be to allow us to smoke on our porches, our apts are far enough away that the neighbors don't have to worry about 2nd hand smoke.  Thank you for listening and I certainly hope you take this into consideration when making your decision.  \n",

      "  I am an Executive Director of a small 20-unit housing authority of duplexes for elderly and those with a disability. We have residents who smoke inside and this rule will have a major impact on them. The most dramatic part of the Rule is the distance restriction of 25 feet. The Rule's restriction does not take into account that this is the individual's home. I understand restricting the smoking from inside but not the distance from buildings. Most of those who smoke will not change to smoke away from the building. I will probably lose most of those who do smoke. This is going to increase our expenses from move-outs and if we had a 25 feet restriction, we will need to build some type of structure so the resident doesn't have to smoke in the rain, snow, wind, etc. And this structure will be more than just 25 feet from some apartments so some residents will have a long distance to go smoke. I don't believe many of the smokers will remain in the program even though they need the housing assistance. Is that HUD's purpose? To get rid of all the smokers?   I'm not opposed to restricting the smoking inside buildings but the distance restriction is not going to work. Please remove that from your Rule.  \n",

The publication of the proposed rule represents  a major step forward in protecting the  millions of Americans who currently live in federally - owned  public housing from the harms of tobacco.    We urge   the   Department of Housin g and Urban  Development   ( HUD )   to adopt a final rule implementing this measure as soon as possible.   At the same time, our organizations believe the proposed rule could and should  also include  electronic  nicotine delivery systems (ENDS)   and  waterpipe   tobacco   (hookah)   in restricted areas .  Our organizations  also believe that the rule should apply to all government - subsidized housing rather than just all  government - owned housing.  Our comments will expand on   these recommendations   below.     2     Our organizations  want   to make clear:  the only way to protect everyone from the dangers of  secondhand smoke is to make the smokefree policies mandatory and make them apply to everyone.   W hile voluntary smokefree policies have been effective   in   allowing   HUD to determine best pr actices for  smokefree policy implementation, voluntary smokefree policies are not sufficient to protect everyone  from secondhand smoke.   policies that delay implementation beyond the  18   month period or allow case - by - case decisions that  would allow some smokers to still smoke indoors.  A  mandatory policy  that applies to everyone from the  beginning of the policy  is  the  only   way   to ensure everyone can breathe clean, safe air in their homes   and  achieve health benefits .     Secondhand Smoke Exposure Poses   Serious Health Threats to Children and Adults   Secondhand smoke (SHS) contains many poisons and cancer - causing chemicals, including nicotine,  carbon monoxide, ammonia, formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, nitrogen oxides, phenol, sulfur dioxide,  lead,  and others. 1   Twenty years ago, in 1992, the U . S .   Environ mental Protection Agency classified SHS as  a Class A known human carcinogen. 2   As such, SHS poses health concerns for all individuals, particularly  children and pregnant women.   The reports of direct health effects of SHS exposure are numerous and growing in   number. The most  comprehensive report of these effects is the 2006 U . S .    The Health  Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke . 3   The report details how even small amounts of  exposure can have serious health effects   and  concludes  that there is no safe level of exposure to  SHS .  SHS can   cause or exacerbate a wide range of adverse health effects, including lung cancer, heart disease,  stroke,  respiratory infections,  sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)   and asthma. 4   The evidenc e supporting the association of SHS exposure of children with respiratory illnesses is strong.  Increased rates of lower respiratory illness, middle - ear infections, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy,  cough, asthma and asthma exacerbations, hospitalizations, a nd  SIDS   have been reported. 5   It has been  estimated that SHS exposure causes asthma symptoms in 200,000 to one million children. 6   One study  indicated that children with asthma who were exposed to SHS had additional co - morbid conditions  including higher leve ls of obesity  compared with unexposed children. 7   The scope of these illnesses is  huge: SHS exposure exacerbates many chronic diseases. Children with sickle cell disease who are  exposed to SHS have a higher risk of crises that require hospita lization than do unexposed children. 8   Finally, in addition to the  exacerbating  chronic conditions, SHS is immediately life - threatening, especially  among vulnerable populations such as infants. In one year alone, SHS exposure  is estimated to have  resulted i n the   death of 900 infants. 9   Another effect of SHS exposure is increased school absenteeism. Analysis of data from the National  Health Interview Survey (NHIS) indicated that 24 to 36   percent   of school absenteeism was related to SHS  exposure in children age s 6 to 11. The study also showed that the number of days that a child was  absent from school predictably increased with the number of active smokers in the household. 10   Even  very low levels of SHS exposure, such as  those  seen in a child with a parent who sm okes only outside, 11   have been associated with decreases in reading and math scores. 12   In addition to SHS exposure for developing children and adolescents, prenatal exposure to SHS has been  associated with   low birthweight, prematurity 13 , and   future susceptibility to nicotine addiction  as well as  significant adverse events in childhood development. One of the significant consequences of prenatal  3     tobacco exposure is sensitization of the fetal brain to nicotine, which results in increased likeli hood of  addiction when the brain is exposed to nicotine at a later age. Studies of rodents 14   and primates 15 , 16   that  were exposed prenatally to tobacco have demonstrated subtle brain changes that persist into  adolescence and are associated with tobacco use, ni cotine addiction, and reduced cognitive function. 17   Population - based human studies have demonstrated associations between prenatal tobacco exposure  and early tobacco experimentation 18   as well as increased likelihood of tobacco use  in adolescence  and  adult hoo d . 19   In addition, further research has indicated adverse developmental effects on infants,  children, and adolescents including lessened perceptual skills, deficits in information processing, and a  significantly higher likelihood of being diagnosed with atte ntion deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 20   Children and the elderly represent a disproportionate ly large   share of fire victims, and smoking  materials are the most common ignition source of fatal residential fires. 21   It has been estimated that  smoking cau ses approximately 30 percent of US fire deaths overall, and that smoking - material fires  accounted for nearly 20   percent   of the 90,000 home structure fire deaths in 2011 according to National  Fire Protection Association data. 22   However, the rate of fire deat hs has decreased as smoking has  decreased, although part of the reduction has been attributed to modifications to cigarette - ignition  resistance in mattresses and upholstered furniture. 23   Residents of  Public   Housing are  Involuntarily  Exposed to Secondhand Sm oke   SHS   is clearly a significant public health hazard, and maintaining a smokefree home is a wise decision to   step  alone is not sufficient to prevent all  exposure to SHS   for residents of multi - unit b uildings . Tobacco smoke does not stay confined within a  single room nor does it stay confined within a single unit in multi - family apartment buildings. Ventilation  systems can distribute SHS throughout a building. 24   SHS can seep through walls and cracks. 25     D ata clearly demonstrate that the residents of smokefree units in multi - family buildings without  smokefree air policies are not safe from tobacco smoke exposure. A Boston - based study published in  2009 measured levels of nicotine, an indicator of SHS exposu re, in 49 low - income units in multi - unit  buildings. Overall, 94 percent of units had detectable nicotine levels, including 89 percent of units where  no one smoked in the home. 26     A 2011 nationally representative study, conducted through the Social Climate S urvey, found that among  individuals who lived in multi - family housing where no one smokes inside the home, 31 percent smelled  smoke in their building. Of these respondents that reported smelling smoke in their building,  approximately half (49 percent) repo rted smelling smoke in their own units, 38 percent reported  smelling smoke in their unit at least once per week, and 12 percent reported smelling smoke in their  unit at least once per day. 27   This nationally representative study confirms the results of sever al state -   and community - level studies measuring prevalence of smoke incursions into smokefree units. 28   This  trend is echoed in a 2012 study that indicated that  although  63 million of the 79 million Americans  who  live in multi - unit housing do not allow smoki ng in their homes approximately 28 million of those  reported secondhand smoke infiltration in their home. 29     Studies published in 2011 and 2012 confirmed that children who live in multi - unit   housing have  significantly higher exposure to  SHS   than those who l ive in detached housing, and that 15 million  children aged 3 - 11 years were exposed to  SHS , representing the highest prevalence of SHS exposure  among all age groups. The studies, using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination  4     Survey (NHANES),   showed that levels of cotinine, a chemical marker of nicotine in the blood, among  children living in multi - unit   housing were significantly higher   than those of chil dren living in detached  housing ;   and that SHS prevalence  compared with adults  was  second - highest among adolescents aged 12  to 19, only superseded by young children. 30 , 31   Prevention of Secondhand Smoke Exposure  Requires   Smokefree Policies   The above evidence clearly demonstrates that residents of multi - family housing are exposed to  SHS   even   if they live in a unit where no one smokes. Therefore, the only way to fully protect children and  adults who live in multi - family housing from secondhand exposure is to implement building - wide  smokefree air policies. In 2007, the World Health Organization   (WHO) presented its clear conclusion that     percent   smokefree environments [is] the only effective strategy to reduce exposure  to tobacco smoke to safe levels in indoor environments and to provide an acceptable level of protection  from the   dangers of  SHS    32   The organization reaffirmed its recommendation in 2014 and  called for a  prohibition  on the use of  ENDS   indoors due to the risks presented by secondhand exposure  to the devices. 33     Partial smokefree policies,  such as  those that pr ohibit smoking in common areas  such as  hallways, will  not protect all residents from SHS. The 2011 Social Climate Survey showed that multi - unit residents in  buildings with the strongest smokefree air policies were the least likely to report smelling smoke.   The  data also showed that policies that only prohibited smoking in common spaces  and not individual  units  did little to prevent residents from smelling smoke. 34   Research  published in  the  American Journal  of Public  Health   has further  shown   that  SHS   exposure   for nonsmokers persist s   despite separating  smokers from nonsmokers within housing, indicating that partial smokefree policies are not effective in  protecting nonsmokers from harm. 35     Experts in building ventilation agree that keeping  individual   unit s   smoke free is  not  sufficient  to   remov e   health risks.  The American Soc iety of Heating, Refrigerating and   Air - Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)   explained in a policy statement   that the only means of effectively eliminating  the  health risk s   associated  with indoor exposure  to  SHS   is to make the   entire indoor area   smokefree. 36   Recent research by public  health professionals has reinforced the fact that scrubbing and ventilating the air in buildings, cannot  completely eliminate exposure SHS and  t he  other harmful substances associated with it. 37     HUD Must Adopt a Nation wide   Smokefree Policy    Our organizations commend the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for its efforts  over the last several  years  to protect the health of residents of federally assisted housing by encouraging  broader adoption of smokefree policies in public housing. In 2009, HUD first encouraged public housing  agencies (PHAs) to adopt smokefree policies, and in 2010, HUD extended th is recommendation to  owners and management agents of  other  federally assisted housing   programs such as the Housing  Choice Voucher program   (also known as   S ection 8 housing ) . A short time  after   for voluntary adoption of smokefree policie s, HUD partnered with the American Academy of Pediatrics,  the American Lung Association, and the Department of Health and Human Services to publish smokefree  housing toolkits   for   both residents and managers of federally assisted housing , which were intende d to  help   in the implementation   of  smokefree policies. Most recently, in 2014, HUD released further  guidance for PHAs and owners of subsidized housing on   implementing successful   voluntary smokefree  policies in their units.    5     To date, over 600 PHAs have succ essfully implemented smokefree policies in some or all units.  None of  these PHAs  have chosen to reverse smokefree policies after  implementation .  Th ese are   important  indication s   that smokefree policies are achievable   and have widespread acceptability after  they are put  in place . However, the current voluntary approach leaves many residents, including 775,000 children,  unprotected from the dangers of tobacco smoke in their own homes. Our organizations strongly support   using smokefree because the only way to protect all residents  of public housing is to adopt a nationwide smokefree policy.   All people, regardless of income, should be able to enjoy healthy housing, free of  SHS   and  other  dangerous conditions.  As private, hi gher - rent, market - rate buildings increasing ly   go smokefree, it is  important that our poorest and most vulnerable citizens not be left out. T he existing lack of smokefree  air policies   in public housing   disproportionately impacts lower - income families  who cannot move due  to   economic, health or other reasons.   Higher - income individuals are better able to relocate their families  to remove them from an unhealthy environment.  Public housing residents are   more   likely to be  member s of vulnerable populations: 3 8   percent   are children, 31   percent   are seniors, 30   percent   are  disabled, a nd 89   percent    38   Further, many residents in multi - family public housing are renters from low - income populations and are more likely to be ra cial or ethnic  minorities, disproportionately exposing these populations to the dangers of SHS exposure. 39   The 2011  Social Climate Survey showed that multi - family housing residents were more likely to smell smoke in  their building if they received governmen t subsidies for their housing. 40   Clearly, the status quo  discriminates against vulnerable populations.   M ulti - unit housing residents consistently report that they desire smokefree air policies.  A   majority of  residents want smokefree air policies implemented  where they live. 41   One study examined the 2012  voluntary implementation of a smokefree policy by the Boston Housing Authority in its housing,  indicating that a year after implementation 91   percent   knew of  the policy prohibiting smoking indoors   and 82   percen t   were strongly supportive of such a policy in their building. 42     While our organizations believe the health and other benefits of making public housing smokefree are  overwhelming, it is likely HUD will receive some comments  opposing  smokefree housing.   One  argument     While  it may be legal to some in some places, it is subject to restrictions on the time and place of  smoking in order to protect the rights o f non - smokers.    Many jurisdictions in the United States have  placed restrictions on where smoking is permitted to protect the health of nonsmokers, and these  restrictions have been almost universally upheld in court cases.    U.S. law supports many restrict ions on the conduct of individuals that affects their neighbors, including  prohibitions on nuisances such as excessive noise levels. Smokefree air policies in buildings do not  prohibit residents from smoking altogether; they only prohibit residents from sm oking in locations that  can cause harm to their neighbors. People who smoke could still be allowed to smoke in outdoor  locations away from the building that would not pose harm to others. Building - wide smokefree air  policies, therefore, do not infringe on  any protected liberties or freedoms afforded to a person who  smokes. Rather, such policies protect the right of all the children and nonsmokers who reside in shared  indoor environments. 43   Smokefree air policies also have collateral benefits for building man agers as nonsmoking units are  significantly less expensive to turn over than smoking units when a tenant moves out. Because turnover  6     costs are two to seven times higher in homes when smoking is allowed, smokefree policies in public  housing can result in mi llions of dollars in savings to PHAs and property managers annually. 44 , 45   Because  the risk of fire is   also   reduced when smokefree air policies are implemented, some insurance companies  offer discounts on property casualty insurance. 46   Reductions in SHS will a lso lead to lower costs to  society, both from decreased health care costs and improved productivity. Smokefree policies may also  encourage existing smokers to quit.   As with any worthwhile public health innovation, there will undoubtedly be implementation c hallenges.  However, as HUD points out, hundreds of PHAs have already implemented smokefree air policies and  found that these challenges are anything but insurmountable. We urge HUD to closely analyze the  comments received in this docket in order to fully u nderstand how these obstacles have been  successfully addressed and overcome in many communities around the nation. We believe that many  commonly cited objections to smokefree air policies  such as a concern that  such measures  will  increase undesirable loite ring outside buildings  have not  posed  significant  problems  when a policy is  actually implemented.   Enforcement has been raised as a particular challenge, with some arguing that smokefree air policies  will result in  increased evictions.  Displacement and/or e viction of residents is an important issue that  can have health and other unintended consequences for residents.   Our organizations have seen that  proper implementation using resources developed by HUD, as well as consistent and uniform  enforcement can pre vent almost all of these challenges.  In addition,  smokefree policy violations should  be treated like any other housing policy violation , e.g.   restrictions on noise levels   and should be  addressed, enforced and respected in the same manner and consistency as   any other housing provision.   Eviction is often a means of last resort for any lease violation and  public housing officials whose  properties have gone smokefree share th at evictions are very rare.     Some have also argued that smokefree policies discriminat e against disabled individuals who may be  less able to smoke outside. In fact,  however,  smoking inside buildings discriminates against the greater  majority of nonsmoking disabled individuals because they cannot escape tobacco smoke infiltrating their  own a partments.  Smoking is not a basic human need and therefore does not require reasonable  accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act.    Nicotine addiction can be addressed using  available, safe,  Food and Drug Administration (FDA)   - approved options   to help smokers quit . These  five  forms of nicotine  replacement therapy  are  available as gum, patch, lozenge, nasal spray, and inhaler   as  well as two non - nicotine medications,  b uproprion and  v arenicline .  Research has shown that with  assistance, smokers can   quit.  Studies have also shown that at least 70 percent of smokers say they want  to quit and over half have made a quit attempt in the past year. 47 , 48    We recognize that some smokers,  especially those with behavioral health or substance abuse issues, may ne ed specially tailored cessation  treatments  that specifically address these issues. In many circumstances those tailored treatments can  be accommodated by working with local health departments and partner organizations .   Overall, the  rights of the disabled  population, including disabled children , veterans,   and those with respiratory  disabilities, are best protected by smokefree building policies that ensure a safe environment for all  residents. 49      Responses to Specific Questions   1.   What barriers that PHAs could   encounter in implementing smokefree housing? What costs could  PHAs incur? Are there any specific costs to enforcing such a policy?   7     Our organizations recognize the greatest challenges to and barriers with implementation are  significantly reduced when there is sufficient lead time before a smokefree policy takes effect.   This time  allows staff to be trained and residents to be empowered  to participate in the rollout and  implementation of the policy.   Resident involvement from the beginning leads to greater buy - in and with  that buy - in comes greater compliance.   Examples of such involvement can include:       Educat ing   staff about why smokefree po  how smokefree policies will lead to reduced fire hazards and how maintenance   costs for units  are   reduced and  turn - over  costs are lower for non - smoking units.       C onduct ing, if resources permit,   a pre -   a nd post - implementation air quality study to detect  SHS   levels in common and non - smoking units.        Conduct ing   resident surveys (please see Appendix A) and focus groups to inform the  development of the smokefree policy.        Schedul ing   multiple meetings with resid ents 2 - 3 months before the policy will go into effect to  share results from the survey, educate residents about the dangers of  SHS , and announce  and/or provide resources for residents who want to quit smoking.      Provid ing   sufficient notification, including l ease addendums and signage, making the policy  known and clear.      Allow ing   residents to help decide where the outside gathering spot for smokers will be.   A kick - off event for residents to celebrate the start of the new smokefree policy has also been a  success ful tactic used by PHAs that have already gone smokefree.      Barriers and less successful implementation are more common when there has been a lack of ad vance   communication with and education of residents.   In a 2010 survey of all public housing authorities  in  Minnesota, conducted by  the Public and Indian Housing   Minneapolis Field Office, the Office of Healthy  Homes and Lead Hazard Control and the American Lung Association of the Upper Midwest,  respondents  were   asked about ob stacles to implementing a smoke fre e policy .   C ompliance and enforcement  were  the  top   obstacle s named   (30%) followed by accommodating current smokers (19%) and losing occupants  (17%). 50     While our organizations urge that everything be done  to help smokers quit, our organizations recognize  the   importance of accommodating those smokers who may not be initially successful.  Previous PHAs  have found that creating  a covered gathering space for smokers or  providing  ashtrays   to be a very  worthwhile expenditure.   Other costs associated with implementin g a smokefree policy mainly relate to  informing residents of the policy, including securing signatures on lease addendums, printing fliers and  purchasing smokefree signs.   However,  as previously mentioned,  smokefree policies will ultimately save  PHAs money   through lower operating and turnover costs for smokefree  units   as opposed to housing  that has been partially or never smokefree .   A 2012 study found that operating costs were lower for  smokefree housing than partially or never smokefree housing properties. 51     As stated above, our organizations strongly recommend HUD include the prohibition of  ENDS  and  waterpipe   tobacco (hookah)   in the final smokefree policy.   Exempting ENDS and hookah  may  make  effective  enforcement   of smokefree policies more difficult.  For ex ample, the  Duluth, Minnesota housing  authority, which allowed e - cigarette use after otherwise going smokefree, reported that when their staff  smelled cigarette smoke, they would knock on the door and residents told them they were using  ENDS . 52     8     Several  early   smokefree policies  were not   comprehensive and did not address smoking on balconies,  patios or by entrances, which also caused implementation challenges.   Our organizations support the  HUD proposal, which addresses both of these issues and protects ten ant health and safety.       As with any policy, staff time will be required for training and communication.   PHAs that have already  gone smokefree have found that staff time associated with enforcement is minimal and similar to the  enforcement of noise and oth er nuisance complaints.     2.   Does this proposed rule adequately address the adverse effects of smoking and secondhand smoke  on PHAs and PHA residents?   In general, for the reasons described above, this proposal  effectively addresses  the adverse effects of  smoki ng and  SHS . However, the proposal could better address these adverse effects by: (1) ensuring  that the policy applies to all federally supported housing, including privately owned housing, (2)  extending  the policy to playgrounds, (3) extending the policy t o   e lectronic nicotine delivery systems  (ENDS), and (4) extending the policy to  waterpipe tobacco ( hookah ) . Each of these issues is discussed in  more detail below.   3.   Does this proposed rule create burdens, costs, or confer benefits specific to families, child ren, persons  with disabilities, owners, or the elderly, particularly if any individual or family is evicted as a result of  this policy?   The U.S. Surgeon General has found there is no safe level of exposure to  SHS . 53   Making all PHAs  smokefree   will lead to an increased quality of life and increased health for every PHA resident, staff  member and visitor.   Residents with health conditions including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease (COPD) and heart disease, will see significant health   improvements once they are no longer  exposed to  SHS , which can exacerbate their diseases.     Youth, children and infants will also significantly  benefit.  SHS   exposure among infants and children causes ear infections, asthma attacks, lung infections  includin g bronchitis and pneumonia and causes an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome  (SIDS). 54 , 55 , 56     The benefits of PHAs becoming smokefree will be realized by individuals and families who face  significant disadvantages. According to the Department of Ho using and Urban Development, 45 percent  of PHA residents are African American (compared to 13.2% of the general population), 37 percent are  children (compared to 23.1% of the general population) and 95 percent are low to extremely low  income.   57   Protecting  these vulnerable populations from the dangers of  SHS   is likely to have a dramatic  impact   and proper implementation will go a long way in addressing the unintended consequences     including eviction and displacement     associated with this policy .       The regul atory impact analysis discusses but does not inc l ude the benefits to smokers who will quit as a  result of the new smokefree policy.  Approximately 70 percent of smokers want to quit smoking, and  adoption of this smokefree policy increases the likelihood th at smokers will quit smoking.  58 Smokers  who successful ly   quit can dramatically improve the quality and length of their lives.     Another financial benefit not properly accounted for in the re gulatory impact assessment   is reduction in  lost productivity costs  attributed to asthma.    absenteeism and when children miss school, their parents miss work. 59    As a result, asthma has a  tremendous economic toll  --   $3.8 billion annually     caused by lost productivity re sulting f rom missed  9     school and work days. 60    In addition to the reduction in healthcare costs that come from a decreased  number of asthma exacerbations, improving the health of individuals with asthma living in public  housing will also reduce the number of  school and work days missed.     The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC)  estimates that cost - savings for renovation costs  will total almost $43 million each year. 61   The smokefree policy will have significant benefits for owners,  who may also expe rience reduced fire insurance costs, as well as residents.    The policy would  also significantly reduce risk for both human and property losses caused by fires.   According to the U.S. Fire Administration, smoking is the leading cause of fatal fires in reside ntial  structures. 62   In the proposed rule, it is estimated there will be a $32 million annual cost savings as the  result of the reduction of fires in PHAs     10 times greater than the regulatory impact analysis estimate of  compliance by PHAs for this regulati on.       Residents who smoke and have mobility issues may have greater challenges with repeat trips outside to  smoke and meet a new smokefree policy that requires smokefree balconies and patios, as well as a 25  foot smokefree zone.   While it is imperative that   smokefree laws be adopted to protect the public    health , some PHAs have worked in advance  with residents who smoke  to relocate them to units closer  to exits or to elevators.   This underscores the need to help all residents, especially those who may have  these physical challenges, with cessation treatments.   A Rhode Island PHA found when it went smokefree  that onsite smoking cessation counseling sessions     either group or one - on - one     were especially  important for and utilized by the elderly and disabled. 63   Evictions must be the very last resort to smokefree policy violations.   As with any other lease violations,  there should be multi - step consequence procedures for infractions.   Smokefree PHAs found that regular  dialogue and direct engagement with smokers, inc luding providing tips on how to comply with the  policy, can lead to success.   Lake County, Illinois Housing Authority begin its smokefree policy in 2008  and while there  were   some documented violations of the policy, there have been no evictions. 64    Duluth,  M innesota      which fully implemented its smokefree policy in 2010     only had one eviction related to its  smokefree policy and PHA officials said that violating the smokefree policy was not the only violation   65   4.   For t hose PHAs that have already implemented a smoke - free policy, what exceptions to the  requirements have been granted based on tenants' requests?   The policy proposed by HUD is to make PHAs smokefree in order to protect all residents, especially  children and o ther vulnerable residents, from the proven dangers of  SHS . Our organizations oppose   a  provision will lead to  enforcement challenges but more importantly, will continue to expos e residents to the dangers of  SHS .   For example, the Duluth,  Minnesota   PHA   not   fundamentally change the nature    of the program or policy. 66   Any exceptions or allowances for  certain tenants to continue to smoke in their units would fundamentally change the nature of the  smokefree policy, which is meant to protect everyone from the dangers of  SHS .   It would also reduce the  savings from maintenanc e costs and increase fire risk relative to a completely smokefree policy.     Instead, as outlined previously, our organizations suggest that building staff work with residents with  physical challenges or mental illnesses who smoke to ens ure they understand t he policy.   Staff might  10     instead relocate smokers so they are closer to elevators or exits to make  outdoor access   easier on  residents.   Further, staff may work with residents who refuse to comply with new smokefree policies to  allow them to move without incur ring expenses related to breaking their lease.    units.   In Duluth, MN, the PHA phased in smokefree policies across a series of buildings, and the last two  were phased in after a year. In addition to the  SHS   exposure continuing for residents in the final two  buildings, a fatal fire occurred in one of the two remaining buildings that allowed smoking indoors.     5.   For those PHAs that have already implemented a smok e - free policy, what experiences, lessons, or  advice would you share based on your experiences with implementing and enforcing the policy?   Our organizations fundamentally recognize the importance of clearly articulating that smokefree polic ies   are   about protecting everyone from  SHS   and not about smokers . Residents must understand that  while  they do not have to quit smoking to live in the building,  they must help maintain a smokefree  environment within the smokefree perimeter established around the b uilding, including inside the  structure .   While our organizations strongly encourage PHAs to partner with local departments of health,  hospitals, community health centers and nonprofit organizations to assist residents who want to quit  smoking, the emphasis   must be on protecting everyone from the dangers of  SHS .     PHAs that have already implemented such policies found that communication and education  were  key  to success.   They also found that a long lead time  was  important to allow for sufficient communication   and education. In some cases, education of staff and residents began more than a year in advance of the  smokefree implementation date so that residents had time to get the help they needed to make a  successful quit attempt. An implementation plan with a l ong lead time also allows for resident surveys  to be conducted,  for sufficient  notice  for residents  about the impending change,  for  staff and resident  education sessions, for signage to be created and for cessation services to be arranged for residents.    B asic education about the dangers of  SHS   and how smoke can migrate between units is necessary. While  many staff and residents may understand that exposure to  SHS   is not healthy, they may not fully  understand how dangerous it is and how it infiltrates betwee n units in multi - unit housing. Officials in  Rhode Island found that most residents wanted to be good neighbors but did not realize that smoke  travelled into nearby units. Another housing authority official found it helpful to ask residents if they  could sm  SHS   travels  similarly.     Other suggestions from smokefree PHAs and our organizations that worked with them include:      Work ing   with tenants to determine whether a designated outside smoking area is appropriate  and if so, where it should be.       Ensur ing   addendums for smokefree policies are included in the lease that outline violations and  consequences.       Document ing   each infraction o f the smokefree policy so that a  record   of all communications  with residents  is  created     including efforts to assist tenants in addition to enforcement.        Listen ing    ing   them ample lead - in time to adjust to the new policy  but a lso enforce it.    11        Help ing   staff and residents understand how smokefree policies will benefit both them and their  neighbors     from the health benefits to the cost savings associated with maintenance and  reduction in fire dangers.          Provid ing   resources to smo kers who want to quit smoking to ensure they have help doing so.  PHAs that are already smokefree have noted that offering cessation assistance  before   the policy  takes effect is critical.       Our organizations also understand and have seen that the vast major ity of tenants are happy with  smokefree policies after they are implemented.   This mirrors satisfaction with smokefree regulations put  in place in other environments including bars , restaurants, and workplaces.   6.   For those PHAs that have already implemented a   smoke - free policy, what tobacco cessation services  were offered to residents to assist with the change? Did you establish partnerships with external  groups to provide or refer residents to these services?   Anecdotal reports from many PHAs that have already   implemented a smokefree policy found that  providing  smoking cessation  services well in advance of the implementation date helps smokers prepare  for implementation and reduce policy violations. In addition, providing quit smoking resources for a  period  after implementation helps smokers who are having trouble quitting and can even show goodwill  on the part of the PHA.       Many of the PHAs that are already smokefree have referred residents to state Quitlines for services.  Some quitlines provide free nicotin e replacement therapy to callers in addition to providing counseling  services. 67   The U.S. Public Health Service has found that combining FDA - approved quit smoking  therapies with counseling services are the most effective for successful quit attempts. 68   Many  PHAs have found it helpful to partner with local public health groups and/or hospitals. The  American Lung Association has worked with PHAs to provide cessation resources via door hangers   and   resident education sessions, tied quitting with promotions such a  American Smokeout, and provided fliers and quit kits for distribution.   In a number of instances, a local  hospital provided group counseling to residents. Rhode Island PHA officials found that onsite cessation  counselin g sessions were most important for elderly and disabled residents, whereas other residents  may find Quitline or text messaging to be more accessible. 69     Recognizing the significant overlap between PHA residents and Medicaid recipients, state Medicaid  progra ms also have the opportunity to increase access to quit smoking benefits including medications  and counseling. According to the American Lung Association, only three state Medicaid programs cover  a comprehensive quit smoking benefit and another 27 states c over all seven FDA - approved medications .  Virtually a l l states still have significant barriers that make it harder for smokers to access that benefit. 70   Partnerships between PHAs, health departments and Medicaid staff can increase access to coverage and  serv ices that will ultimately help residents quit smoking.    Other partnerships might include federally qualified health centers and local health departments that  can also assist smokers in getting the help they need to quit.  We strongly recommend that HUD  cont inue to provide resources and best practices for PHAs to link their residents who smoke to the  cessation services available.    12     7.   Are there specific areas of support that HUD could provide PHAs that would be particularly helpful in  the implementation of the pr oposed rule?   Representatives from many of our organizations who have worked with PHAs recommend:      Template signage, including multiple choices to allow for a variety of building layouts;       Toolkits containing sample timelines on how best to implement smokefr ee policies, education  materials for staff and residents, including sample resident surveys, lease addendums, a sample       8.   Should the policy extend to electronic nicotine delivery systems, such as   e - cigarettes?   Smokefree policies should extend to the use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS).   The  nicotine - containing liquid aerosolized by ENDS  has been found to  contain several harmful compounds,  including heavy metals and tobacco - specific n itrosamines, which  can be  carried over from the tobacco  into the liquid during the nicotine extraction process. 71 , 72   Even propylene glycol, a main ingredient of   respiratory irritation for those exposed to exhaled vapor, even in non - asthmatic patients. 73     There is insufficient research on the long - term effects of using e - cigarettes, which involves regular  inhalation of nicotine, glycerin or some other solvent, and  other additives. 74   According to the CDC, e -  75   E - cigarette aerosol  contains nicotine, which is absorbed by users and bystanders. 76   Studies have found other chemicals and  toxins  present in some e - cigarettes,  including formaldehyde, acrolein, volatile organic compounds like  toluene, tobacco - specific nitrosamines, and metals like nickel and lead. 77   These compounds are  generally present at levels much lower than in cigarette smoke, al though the compounds themselves   78   Because e - cigarettes are not yet  regulated by the FDA and are available in hundreds of different brands 79 , there is no way for consumers  to know for sure  what is in the products or the aerosol. 80   P reliminary animal model data  has shown   damage to growing lungs resulting from second - han d exposure to  ENDS  aerosols . Two studies show  developmental changes and organ effec ts in mice exposed to ENDS aero sols. 81   T he n egative health  impact of   ENDS  on   non - users, including   children ,   deserves more research.    In addition,  the manufacture of ENDS   is currently unregulated by the federal government and there is  not a  standardized method for safety testing. Recent studies have  shown that due to the extensive  variability in design and function, as well as the relative ease with which users may make modifications  to the battery, case, and heating element of these products, explosion and fire hazards have been seen  with these produ cts. 82   An October 2014 report from the U.S. Fire Administration found that improper  use of charging devices can lead to explosion and fire and that because of the shape and size of  ENDS ,   83     In  2015, the Federal Aviation   ENDS   in checked bags.  In the alert, the  FAA highlighted examples of  ENDS   that have caught fire when the heating element was activated by  accident. 84   The report and alert highlight the risk posed to housing units from  ENDS   and underscores  that from a safety perspective,  ENDS   use indoors should also be prohibited.    Lastly, use of ENDS in smoking - restricted areas would make it more difficult to enforce s mokefree  policies since use of ENDS often looks indistinguishable from cigarette smoking.      13     9.   Should the policy extend to waterpipe tobacco smoking? Does such smoking increase the risk of fire  or property damage?   Smokefree policies should extend to the use o f   waterpipe tobacco   ( hookah ) . According to the CDC ,  SHS   from hookah     which comes from both the tobacco and the charcoal typically used to heat it     poses  health risks to nonusers. 85   A study conducted in Virginia showed that air quality in waterpipe cafes  w as  worse than in restaurants that permitted cigarette smoking. It also showed that air quality in non - smoking rooms in waterpipe cafes was poor, demonstrating how  SHS   from hookah can easily travel to  adjacent spaces. 86   One study showed that the exposure   of  nicotine, tobacco - specific nitrosamines, and  cilia/cardio - toxins such as acrolein in children in the homes of daily, and even weekly or monthly,  hookah smokers was significantly higher than in children living in nonsmoking environments,  representing a seri ous threat to child health. 87   The heat source  used with hookah  also poses risks of  fire  and other property damage.   Additional  Recommendations   25 - Foot  Buffer Zone   Our organizations are supportive of the proposed  25 - foot buffer zone from entrances, exits, win dows  and ventilation  intakes of   buildings in the proposed rule , and including patios and balconies in the  policy .  This buffer zone will assist with enforcement by ensuring that  SHS   does not drift back into living  units from outside or require residents ,  staff or visitors   to walk through clouds of  SHS   around entrances  or exits from buildings.    One study that looked at  SHS   exposure outside restaurants and bars found that  exposure to  SHS   was higher than normal outdoor air levels. 88    Some early adopters of smo kefree policies  that did not include a sufficient buffer zone, or allowed smoking to continue on balconies and patios   that  SHS   still came into units when   smoking occurred on balconies, patios or outside windows.       Implementation Timeframe    of the  final regulation being released.  Experiences from the PHAs th at are already smokefree show that  an effective implementation can occur within an 18 month period.  That will allow PHAs to  educate their  staffs, empower and involve their residents in implementation, secure addendums for leases and work  with public healt h partners to ensure residents who want to  quit can get the help they need.    Our organizations also encourage  HUD to finalize this rule within six months   to ensure adequate  implementation before the end of the Administration .     Inclusion of  All   Federally S upported   Housing   The proposed rule would  only apply to public housing, but would not apply to housing units in mixed - finance developments . It would also not apply to p rivately owned, federally sub sidized multifamily  housing such  as  project - based Section 8  housing. The type of housing program a family participates in  should not dictate whether that family is protected from the harms of  SHS . We strongly urge HUD to  apply the smokefree housing rule to all types of housing that are supported by the federal gove rnment.   HUD has been a leader in protecting  children living in housing supported by programs such as Section 8  from the hazards of lead - based paint. SHS exposure has been linked to higher blood lead levels in  14     children. 89   Extending smokefree policies to Sect  efforts to protect the negative health consequences associated with lead exposure.   If HUD chooses not to require all supported housing to implement smokefree   policies, we suggest that  HUD, at a minimum, include smokefree policies in all model lease language published by the agency.   Inclusion of Playgrounds   The proposed rule specifies that PHA s   may prohibit smoking near playgrounds, but unfortunately stops  shor t of requiring that smokefree policies extend to outdoor spaces designed for use by children. We  strongly recommend that the final rule extend the smokefree policy to playgrounds outside the 25 - foot  buffer zone around buildings. It would be  a  serious missed  opportunity if this rule protects children from  SHS   in their homes but fails to protect them where they play outdoors. Therefore, we recommend that  playgrounds and other outdoor facilities intended for use by children be added to the definition of      a 25 - foot buffer zone around such  playgrounds.   Clarification on Indoor Spaces    units and interior common  areas .    We recommend that    from this paragraph in order to clarify that  smoking would be prohibited throughout the entire building. For instance, this would clarify that indoor  spaces where residents are not typically allowed, such as utility rooms and m aintenance facilities, would  also be included in the smokefree policy.   Clarification on  Ability to Prohibit All Tobacco Products    recommended expanding the proposal t o include ENDS and hookah. If HUD chooses not to extend the  policy to either ENDS or hookah, we urge HUD to specify in §965.653 that PHA s   may choose to do so  voluntarily.   Conclusion   Thank you for moving forward on this critical public health issue. We look   forward to continuing to work  with HUD to promote healthy living environments, free of exposure to  SHS , for all children and adults.  Many of our organizations also advocate for smokefree workplace laws as well as policies to ensure that  all smokers have a ccess to proven cessation services to help them quit, particularly smokers who are  newly insured, Medicaid - eligible, and uninsured.

      "    This pretty well destroys the Myth of second hand smoke:    Lungs from pack-a-day smokers safe for transplant, study finds.  By JoNel Aleccia, Staff Writer, NBC News.  Using lung transplants from heavy smokers may sound like a cruel joke, but a new study finds that organs taken from people who puffed a pack a day for more than 20 years are likely safe.  What's more, the analysis of lung transplant data from the U.S. between 2005 and 2011 confirms what transplant experts say they already know: For some patients on a crowded organ waiting list, lungs from smokers are better than none.  \"I think people are grateful just to have a shot at getting lungs,\" said Dr. Sharven Taghavi, a cardiovascular surgical resident at Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, who led the new study...........................  Ive done the math here and this is how it works out with second ahnd smoke and people inhaling it!  The 16 cities study conducted by the U.S. DEPT OF ENERGY and later by Oakridge National laboratories discovered:  Cigarette smoke, bartenders annual exposure to smoke rises, at most, to the equivalent of 6 cigarettes/year.  146,000 CIGARETTES SMOKED IN 20 YEARS AT 1 PACK A DAY.  A bartender would have to work in second hand smoke for 2433 years to get an equivalent dose.  Then the average non-smoker in a ventilated restaurant for an hour would have to go back and forth each day for 119,000 years to get an equivalent 20 years of smoking a pack a day! Pretty well impossible ehh!  .\n",
