       " 'comment_list': array([ '- I have added additional commentary to my original comment, with the full comments below:\\n- How much discussion has there been regarding a flat fee option, rather than being based on the number of appraisers doing business with the AMC? Commentary and discussion have likened this ASC fee to the fee embedded in appraiser\\'s state renewal fees; however, their is a significant difference: appraisers are not paying their ASC fee based on how much they work - it is a one-sized flat fee. While the impact of a per-appraiser fee could easily be absorbed by large AMCs, it could have significant negative impact on smaller, local, and regional AMCs that provide service to lenders, banks, and credit unions. Additionally, a flat one-sized fee, rather than a per-appraiser fee, would be more easily calculated, enforced, and collected, and would have less impact on AMCs.\\n- Nevertheless, in the absence of an apparent consideration of a flat one-sized fee option, the option (third) for calculating the number of appraisers to count is a good option (of those discussed in the proposal): counting only the number of appraisers who have actually performed services, and excluding appraisers who may simply be on an \"active\" panel with the AMC but have not actually performed appraisal services during that time. \\n- Using the third option in the rule would not \"penalize\" AMCs that choose to pro-actively build a panel of appraisers who have necessary qualifications, experience, quality of work samples, etc. in order to more quickly assign client\\'s orders when requested. The alternative that some AMCs might otherwise choose would be to populate an appraisal panel only at the time a lender-client has a request; the screening and approving of appraisers can be time-consuming, so the freedom to build and manage panels ahead of time without fear of additional costs, under the third option, makes sense. \\n- In terms of state burdens (note I am not a state regulator), I believe the use of the third counting method is useful for states, as it would be in line with processes some states already require and request. For example, some states already ask an AMC during an audit for a list of assignments from during a certain period of time. Typically, the appraiser name and or license number would be transmitted with this data. From this data, both the AMC and the state regulator could know the appropriate count of unique appraisers. Again, a flat one-sized fee would eliminate the burden on states, AMCs, and the ASC in terms of tracking, counting, reporting, etc.\\n- Clarification could be useful, that ordering reviews or additional appraisals for audit type purposes do not count, as those services are not conducted for a lender-client, but rather are for internal AMC purposes only.',\n",

The residential appraiser in the last few years have literally been hit by a bus and then the bus backed up and ran over the appraiser again. All this is going to do is subtract from the appraisers bottom and add money to the AMCS bottom line. Quite frankly I would love to have someone else pay my expenses. This will have a devastating on the appraiser who is self employed    \\nThe AMCS in and of themselves are already passing along every possible fee and expense to the appraiser with no end in sight. It has gotten to a point where there will be a shortage of appraisers not because there are not enough appraiser but because no one can make a living in the business as it exist now and going into the future.

Are they going to raise the fee they pay me?\\nRequiring me to pay fee to on their panel, is nothing more than a pure profit making \"tax\" laid in the back of the appraiser. \\nThis fee is part of their daily business expense and not mine.\\n\\nDue to the implementation of Dodd Frank many lenders have moved to the AMC model for appraisal ordering. In order to maintain my business with clients I have had for over 16 years I had to join an AMC panel, so I could receive work. Since that time I have these AMC offer lower fees than I was paid prior to their implementation. Often times I received orders with fees from $25-75 less than I was paid before. \\nRecenlty due to legislation at the state level and years of trying we are finally beginning to receive work from many AMC at a competitive level.\\n\\nNow they want to charge me $25/year to be on their panel or I can not receive work. Again this is from lender that I dealt with before Dodd-Frank and the implementation of the AMC model.\\nI have read numerous articles this year on many national AMC\\'s that have set record profits in the billions, merged and combined with other AMC\\'s to become even larger and control even more of the appraisal ordering and the valuation process in this country. \\nHow can these companies now own and control many MLS systems in the US, along with many data verification sources, title companies, mortgage insurances companies. \\n\\nAs I have already said \"Requiring me to pay fee to on their panel, is nothing more than a pure profit making \"tax\" laid in the back of the appraiser\".

You may say you do not have to take what they want to pay but if you want to stay in business you have no choice. When will some one stand up for the appraisers.

       "        'It should be noted that the proposed AMC fee is likely to be passed on to individual panel appraisers. It is also likely to further complicate the already difficult relationship between AMC and appraiser and is likely to limit the number of appraisers accepted into any AMC\\'s panel. \\n\\nThis will cause an increase in the turn-around time for appraisal products (especially in rural service areas) and will certainly increase the likelihood that an appraiser will be asked to perform appraisal services outside his/her area of strict geographical competence. Additionally I foresee the proposed change will cause an increased compliance burden for appraisers as AMCs work to determine which appraisers are on which panel in which year.\\n\\nThe cost of this oversight should be born by the AMCs, not the appraisers they employ.   This is the likely outcome should the proposed rule proceed on it\\'s current funding basis.\\n\\nAs an alternative...    A better methodology would be to assess the fee based on the total number of federally regulated assignments completed by all of an AMC\\'s roster appraisers for the previous 12 month term (however defined by an individual state).  This funding basis can be roughly analogous, would remove the direct one-to-one passing on of the new fee to contracted appraisers, would relieve the tightening of the appraiser pool, would relieve the additional compliance burden for appraisers, and would reduce any additional pressure on appraisers to strain the bounds of their geographical competence.\\n\\nIt might be said here that additional AMC protections such as a required \"default pool\" against AMC non-payment (such as Kentucky requires), addressing the pass-through nature of liability under the current AMC paradigm (AMCs do not generally accept any liability for the final product), and protections against AMC stipulation of burdensome assignment conditions which regularly usurp the appraisers mandate to determine the scope-of-work for any particular assignment, might be in order.\\n\\nWe appraisers, all of us, want to, have the space to do the very best work possible on behalf of the public\\'s trust and in support of the good and orderly transfer of real property among market participants. Please consider carefully what this, and other, potential rule changes will do to this cadre of front-line professionals.

Per Dodd-Frank Act the Appraiser should be paid a customary and reasonable fee without the burden of then having to essentially pay back operating costs for the AMC or Lender.\\n\\nI routinely receive requests for some of the most complicated orders one might imagine and yet the offered fee may be 50% of private study C&R fees. Yet another scenario is the AMC that has a \"fee structure\". If an appraiser has their name placed on that list, suddenly the AMC determines those fees to C&R even if they were put into place years ago. So basically all burdens are placed on the appraiser. Yet another scenario is the AMC that states \"we\\'re tying to get you guys higher fees!\" ... well, to the AMC, I say, no you are not because if you were, all you have to do is refuse to work with lenders that will not pay appraises C&R fees.\\n\\nSo if the Dodd-Frank Act truly intended to provided C&R fees to appraisers, provide transparency to consumers, and regulate the AMC business, then these entities need to be clearly separate as there are still many AMCs that are no more than order packagers and shippers. By many requests I receive it is clear their intentions are simply to accept an order from a lender, pull it off the warehouse shelf, and have it shipped back to the lender as quickly as possible while retaining as much of any collectable fees as possible.\\n\\nI have experienced this both as an appraiser and a consumer. When I apply for a loan, sign a letter to pay $460 for an appraisal to an AMC, then find out the lender is using the AMC that I do work for. However the AMC will offer me the order for $350 and if I counter to C&R the order is cancelled.\\n\\nConversely, I have met homeowners that told me they paid $460 for my appraisal, yet I\\'m standing there with an order form stating that if I speak of the fee I receive it will be grounds for my removal from their panel and knowing full well I am not being paid that fee. All the while, the consumer, if they even know an AMC is involved has no idea what they do. In many cases it is certainly not what their name implies. Many should perhaps be named FMCs or Fee Management Companies.\\n\\nSo it is painfully clear to me that the appraiser nor the consumer are being protected here and the only solution is rulemaking that prevent the AMC from being able to operate in this manner. \\n\\nRespectfully.\\n\\nThomas W Baldwin',\n",

       "'- I have added additional commentary to my original comment, with the full comments below:\\n- How much discussion has there been regarding a flat fee option, rather than being based on the number of appraisers doing business with the AMC? Commentary and discussion have likened this ASC fee to the fee embedded in appraiser\\'s state renewal fees; however, their is a significant difference: appraisers are not paying their ASC fee based on how much they work - it is a one-sized flat fee. While the impact of a per-appraiser fee could easily be absorbed by large AMCs, it could have significant negative impact on smaller, local, and regional AMCs that provide service to lenders, banks, and credit unions. Additionally, a flat one-sized fee, rather than a per-appraiser fee, would be more easily calculated, enforced, and collected, and would have less impact on AMCs.\\n- Nevertheless, in the absence of an apparent consideration of a flat one-sized fee option, the option (third) for calculating the number of appraisers to count is a good option (of those discussed in the proposal): counting only the number of appraisers who have actually performed services, and excluding appraisers who may simply be on an \"active\" panel with the AMC but have not actually performed appraisal services during that time. \\n- Using the third option in the rule would not \"penalize\" AMCs that choose to pro-actively build a panel of appraisers who have necessary qualifications, experience, quality of work samples, etc. in order to more quickly assign client\\'s orders when requested. The alternative that some AMCs might otherwise choose would be to populate an appraisal panel only at the time a lender-client has a request; the screening and approving of appraisers can be time-consuming, so the freedom to build and manage panels ahead of time without fear of additional costs, under the third option, makes sense. \\n- In terms of state burdens (note I am not a state regulator), I believe the use of the third counting method is useful for states, as it would be in line with processes some states already require and request. For example, some states already ask an AMC during an audit for a list of assignments from during a certain period of time. Typically, the appraiser name and or license number would be transmitted with this data. From this data, both the AMC and the state regulator could know the appropriate count of unique appraisers. Again, a flat one-sized fee would eliminate the burden on states, AMCs, and the ASC in terms of tracking, counting, reporting, etc.\\n- Clarification could be useful, that ordering reviews or additional appraisals for audit type purposes do not count, as those services are not conducted for a lender-client, but rather are for internal AMC purposes only.'"
