       "'I strongly encourage all public housing agency (PHA) administering public housing to administer a smoke-free policy. A smoke-free policy would create a more healthy and safe environment for residents and staff. Cigarettes are the leading cause of home fire fatalities in the United States.1 Smoking kills over 480,000 U.S. residents each year either from their own smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke.2 Smoking in multiunit unit dwellings exposes smokers and non-smokers alike, regardless of whether a family or individual prohibits smoking inside a unit.  For example, in a study published in 2009, researchers measured metabolized nicotine in residents of non-smoking homes located in multiunit buildings.3 They found that 89% of the residents in non-smoking homes were nevertheless exposed to secondhand smoking at rates up to the equivalent of .84 cigarettes a day. This means that residents who live in multiunit dwellings essentially cannot have a smoke-free home unless the entire building is non-smoking.\\n The U.S. Surgeon General warns that exposure to secondhand smoke causes long term and acute health problems in non-smokers.4 Exposure leads to lung cancer, other cancers, increased risk of stroke and heart attack. Children experience respiratory problems and exposure is even a risk factor for SIDS. Some of the worst health problems caused by exposure occur among people with disabilities, such as Asthma. Secondhand smoke is a contributing factor to Asthma and a common cause of Asthma attacks. \\nThe proposed rule confers a specific benefit to persons with mental and physical disabilities, especially when resulting in mobility challenges and are unable to move away from unwanted secondhand smoke drift within their own unit. Many who live in public housing are especially affected by exposure to secondhand smoke because of disabilities that render them particularly sensitive to smoke contaminants. As of 2012, 38 percent of households in public housing in the U.S. and 36 percent in New York included disabled persons.5 \\nLikewise, this rule is especially beneficial to children. Home is the primary source of SHS exposure for children. Americans who live in multiunit housing can be exposed to unwanted SHS that seeps into their own smoke-free units from other units or common areas where smoking occurs. A 2010 study of multiunit housing residents in New York State found that 73 percent of tenants did not allow smoking in their units, but 46 percent experienced unwanted secondhand smoke infiltration from other units during the past year.6 This problem is made worse by the fact that many in affordable housing cannot move to escape exposure. For them, living affordable housing means accepting exposure to secondhand smoke as daily fact of life.\\nIn my daily work I encounter youth that live in public housing and are exposed to secondhand smoke. Because of where they live if they are lucky enough to not have family members who are smokers, they are still exposed to deadly secondhand smoke. As mentioned about this can cause many health issues in children and can cause more serious issues as they get older. If we want to truly create a World without cancer, this would be an encouraging start to protect children who cannot choose and are unable to change their living situations. Smoke-free public housing gives these children a fighting chance to having a healthier life.  \\n\\n1. www.firesafecigarettes.org \\n2. \"Toll of Tobacco in the United States\"\\n3.

       "\"I have been fascinated for years as to why and how easy it was for Nazi ideology in 1930's Germany to convince normal, intelligent, rational Germans to hate Jews and other minorities with such vicious fervour. I have met many Germans and found them no less sane, intelligent, nor immoral than, say, British or Americans. Why did those apparently normal Germans allow, even encourage a pathological psychopath to treat the Jewish race etc. with such disdain that eventually led to such a disastrous and tragic end-game solution? Please take a minute to consider this and try to explain, to your own satisfaction, how this happened. Also, in terms of basic human nature and susceptibility to influence by dark forces, what makes us any different today?\\n\\nI have to say that I am aghast to see a similar scenario being played out in modern-day USA (and UK) and this proposal is a pretty good example of that process. Reading some of the comments, It becomes clearer to me how apparently normal people can be led into supporting evil, without them realising it. \\n\\nWhile I appreciate that the majority of comments on here are from representatives of the wealthy tobacco CONTROL industry in all its forms, I am sure that there will also be many lay-persons who have been led to believe that smokers do represent a threat to their health. The threat of ill health caused by Jews was the central plank of the de-normalization campaign aimed at Jews in the 1930's too. In BOTH cases that threat was false / grossly exaggerated; manufactured in order to invoke irrational fear amongst the unsuspecting. (and no doubt those same people will want to invoke 'Godwin's Law' to discredit any such comparisons).  But there is more to this than just manufactured irrational fear. People have been deceived by 'experts' into wrongly believing that the 'science' behind smoking is settled and that their actions are promoting 'good', not evil. I suggest that the Milgram Experiments in the 1960's, replicated in 2009 (should be viewed on YouTube) provides part of the explanation. \\n\\nI have attached a copy of my consultation response to the British government (2014) regarding a proposal to ban smoking in cars (The issues are basically the same). I examine anti-smoker rhetoric and 'science' that has been reduced to nothing more than an advocacy tool to promote their dogma. You may note that I predicted this attack on peoples freedoms, homes and private lives nearly two years ago but I am no clairvoyant, this is an obvious progression in salami-slice prohibition. \\n\\nMake no mistake, this proposed ordinance WILL cause much hardship and probably much much worse, amongst those who refuse to be bullied. Wider society and other minority groups will also be adversely affected as a result of the precedent this would set - with worldwide implications. This should NEVER be tolerated in any civilised society. The main proponents, of this attempt to segregate and degrade the identities of certain minorities in society (it is NOT about health), think that they are untouchable. With the current experts-can-do-no-wrong blind culture that currently pervades western society, this is probably the case - for the time being at least. It could however, be a good time for good people to collate relevant evidence so that those individuals responsible can be called to account WHEN this insidious culture eventually collapses.\\n\""
