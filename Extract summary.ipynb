       "'SUMMARY: This action would require a person to carry a pilot  certificate with photo to exercise the privileges of the pilot  certificate. This proposal responds to section 4022 of the Intelligence  Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA). The FAA previously  required all pilots to obtain a plastic certificate (excepting  temporary certificates and student pilot certificates). This proposal  furthers the fulfillment of IRTPA by requiring a photo of the pilot to  be on all pilot certificates. The FAA also proposes to require student  pilots to obtain a plastic certificate with photo. Student pilot  certificates would also have the same duration as other pilot  certificates. Additionally, because of the new photo requirements, this  proposal modifies the application process and the fee structure for  pilot certificates.  '"

       "National Seashore (Seashore) is located approximately three miles off \n",
       "the mainland in the central coastal area of North Carolina. Consisting \n",
       "of more than 29,000 acres of land and water from Ocracoke Inlet to \n",
       "Beaufort Inlet, the 56 miles of barrier islands consist mostly of wide, \n",
       "bare beaches with low dunes covered by scattered grasses, flat \n",
       "grasslands bordered by dense vegetation, maritime forests, and large \n",
       "expanses of salt marsh alongside the sounds. The Seashore serves as a \n",
       "popular recreation destination where visitors participate in a variety \n",
       "of recreational activities. The Seashore also contains important \n",
       "habitat for wildlife created by the Seashore's dynamic environmental \n",
       "processes. Several species listed under the Endangered Species Act, \n",
       "including the piping plover, seabeach amaranth, red knot, and four \n",

       "\n",
       "    In the statute commonly known as the NPS Organic Act (54 U.S.C. \n",
       "100101), Congress granted the National Park Service (NPS) broad \n",
       "authority to regulate the use of areas under its jurisdiction. The \n",

       "[National Park] System units.'' 54 U.S.C. 100751(a). In the Seashore's \n",

       "purposes but also in frequent conflict with wise land and resource \n",
       "management practices, environmental values, and other types of \n",

       "this rule as ``E.O.'' The E.O. requires Federal agencies that allow \n",

       "routes on public lands where the use of motorized vehicles may be \n",
       "permitted. Specifically, section three of the E.O. requires agencies to \n",
