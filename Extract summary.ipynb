Secondhand smoke (SHS) contains hundreds of toxic chemicals  and is designated as a known human carcinogen by the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency, the U.S. National Toxicology Program, and the  International Agency for Research on Cancer. Exposure to SHS can  also cause sudden infant death syndrome and respiratory symptoms such  as cough and wheeze, middle ear infections, and slowed lung growth and  reduced lung function in children, and increased risk of stroke in  adults. The Surgeon General has concluded that there is no riskfree  level of exposure to SHS, and that eliminating smoking in indoor spaces  fully protects nonsmokers from exposure to secondhand smoke.',\n",
       "  'SHS can move both from  external hallways into apartments and between adjacent units. A  study of public housing documented lower concentrations of SHS  contaminants in buildings covered by smokefree policies (i.e.,  policies prohibiting the smoking of tobacco products in all indoor  spaces) compared to buildings without these policies. Analysis of  data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)  demonstrated evidence of greater SHS exposure among children (aged 6 to  18) living in multiunit housing through measurements of cotinine (a  metabolite of nicotine) in their blood. The study demonstrated that  children living in nonsmoking households in apartments had 45 percent  higher levels of cotinine in their blood compared to children living in  nonsmoking households in detached homes.',\n",
       "  \"      In October 2012, HUD also published a Federal Register notice that  solicited feedback on the HUD's smokefree housing initiative,  specifically seeking information on topics such as best practices and  practical strategies from housing providers who have implemented smoke free policies, potential obstacles to policy implementation and how  these could be overcome, suggestions for supporting housing providers  and residents to facilitate policy implementation, and feedback from  housing providers who have decided not to implement smokefree  policies. HUD received many comments in response to this  solicitation, largely from public health organizations and State and  local health departments, expressing support for the concept and citing  the great health risks posed by smoking and SHS.        77 FR 60712, ``Request for Information on Adopting Smoke Free Policies in PHAs and Multifamily Housing'' (October 4, 2012).\",\n",
       "  \"Rather, HUD is proposing a  prohibition on smoking inside public housing living units and indoor  common areas, public housing administrative office buildings, public  housing community rooms or community facilities, public housing day  care centers and laundry rooms, in outdoor areas within 25 feet of the  housing and administrative office buildings, and in other areas  designated by a PHA as smokefree (collectively, ``restricted areas'').\"],\n",
       " 'summary': ' This proposed rule would require each public housing agency  (PHA) administering public housing to implement a smoke-free policy.  Specifically, this rule proposes that no later than 18 months from the  effective date of the final rule, each PHA must implement a policy  prohibiting lit tobacco products in all living units, indoor common  areas in public housing, and in PHA administrative office buildings (in  brief, a smoke-free policy for all public housing indoor areas). The  smoke-free policy must also extend to all outdoor areas up to 25 feet  from the housing and administrative office buildings. HUD proposes  implementation of smoke-free public housing to improve indoor air  quality in the housing, benefit the health of public housing residents  and PHA staff, reduce the risk of catastrophic fires, and lower overall  maintenance costs.

       "National Seashore (Seashore) is located approximately three miles off \n",
       "the mainland in the central coastal area of North Carolina. Consisting \n",
       "of more than 29,000 acres of land and water from Ocracoke Inlet to \n",
       "Beaufort Inlet, the 56 miles of barrier islands consist mostly of wide, \n",
       "bare beaches with low dunes covered by scattered grasses, flat \n",
       "grasslands bordered by dense vegetation, maritime forests, and large \n",
       "expanses of salt marsh alongside the sounds. The Seashore serves as a \n",
       "popular recreation destination where visitors participate in a variety \n",
       "of recreational activities. The Seashore also contains important \n",
       "habitat for wildlife created by the Seashore's dynamic environmental \n",

       "including the piping plover, seabeach amaranth, red knot, and four \n",

       "Authority and Jurisdiction To Promulgate Regulations\n",
       "\n",
       "    In the statute commonly known as the NPS Organic Act (54 U.S.C. \n",
       "100101), Congress granted the National Park Service (NPS) broad \n",
       "authority to regulate the use of areas under its jurisdiction. The \n",

       "[National Park] System units.'' 54 U.S.C. 100751(a). In the Seashore's \n",

       "purposes but also in frequent conflict with wise land and resource \n",
       "management practices, environmental values, and other types of \n",

       "this rule as ``E.O.'' The E.O. requires Federal agencies that allow \n",

       "routes on public lands where the use of motorized vehicles may be \n",
       "permitted. Specifically, section three of the E.O. requires agencies to \n",

       "compatibility of such uses with existing conditions in populated areas, \n",
       "taking into account noise and other factors.\n",

       " 'Of these costs,  HUD expects that the expense of additional enforcement efforts may be  the highest.',\n",
